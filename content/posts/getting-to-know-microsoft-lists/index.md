## Introduction

As [Microsoft Lists starts rolling out to Microsoft 365](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/microsoft-lists-begins-general-availability-roll-out-to/ba-p/1524768), I find that more and more people seem to get confused about Microsoft Lists vs SharePoint, or complaining about how theyâ€™ll have to "learn a new product â€¦ again!".

To help alleviate concerns, I thought it would be a great opportunity to introduce you to the upcoming list templates that will be available when it shows up on your tenant.

Iâ€™m not using a secret preview of Lists or anything like that; I have cobbled the information from public Microsoft materials. As such, the actual details described in this post may change when Lists roll out completely.

Lists Home
----------

When it becomes available on your tenant, youâ€™ll find a new **Lists** icon in your suite bar (a.k.a. "The Waffle"). This is where youâ€™ll find your recent lists, your favorite lists, and where youâ€™ll be able to create lists easily.

![The Lists Home](../../images/post/uploads//2020/07/image-1595957936987.png)

You can create a new list by selecting **\+ Create new list** at the top of the screen and selecting to create from a **Blank list**, **From Excel**, **From an Existing List** or pick from the existing **Templates**.

![Create new list](../../images/post/uploads//2020/07/image-1595958866779.png)

Note that youâ€™ll also be able to create a list from SharePoint (under **Site Content** | **New** | **List**) and from Microsoft Teams.

![Site Content | New | List in SharePoint](../../images/post/uploads//2020/07/image-1595958253720.png)

Iâ€™ll cover the templates at your disposal (since everything else hasnâ€™t changed much)

As of now, the templates that are available are (may be subject to change):

* Issue Tracker
* New hire checklist
* Event itinerary
* Business trip approvals
* Team evaluations
* Asset tracker
* Project planning
* Social media calendar

Letâ€™s cover each one in greater details

Issue Tracker
-------------

The issue tracker makes it easy to manage issues, track statuses, priorities, and notify your team when things happen.

![Issue Tracker](../../images/post/uploads//2020/07/image-1595959320710.png)

You can imagine adding this list to every project site

Employee Onboarding
-------------------

One of those lists that every organization should have, the onboarding list helps you manage new employees as they start on their first day at your company.

![Employee Onboarding](../../images/post/uploads//2020/07/image-1595960078329.png)

It looks like this would be a generic list you would show on an Employee orientation site. The same items would appear for every employee, although you could use this list to create new workflow tasks for new employees.

Event Itinerary
---------------

A great way to plan events.

![file](../../images/post/uploads//2020/07/image-1595961737973.png)

So this is how Microsoft plans all these awesome events?!

An great way to keep track of all your stuff, and whether they are checked-in and returned (and when).

NOTE TO SELF: Must create an asset manager list to keep track of all the stuff I lent to my neighbors.

Seems to be designed to make it easy to adapt to your own business process. I hope that one day Iâ€™ll show up on one of those lists at Microsoft ðŸ˜‰

Travel requests
---------------

This list template doesnâ€™t have a description. Probably because no one is traveling right now.

![Travel](../../images/post/uploads//2020/07/image-1595963570623.png)

Not only is this list useful for tracking travel requests, but you could also use it to track whoâ€™s currently away (in case of emergencies, etc.)

Imagine using this when creating a blog post series with multiple guest authors, but you could also use this for issuing RFPs, responding to proposals, etc.

Conclusion
----------

As you can see, Microsoft Lists are going to be useful, but theyâ€™re also going to be very familiar because theyâ€™re really your good old SharePoint lists, but made available outside of SharePoint.

I hope this helps?

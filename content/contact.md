I am passionate about technology, and I love to share my experiences with others. If you have any questions, comments, or feedback, please do not hesitate to contact me. I will do my best to respond to you as soon as possible.

Please do not contact me to sell me anything, to ask for advertising opportunities, or to ask me to solve problems with SPFx samples. Spam and unsolicited emails automatically get deleted, and I will not be able to respond to such requests.

Don't bother calling me: I guarantee I will not answer your call -- ask my family ðŸ¤£!

[{"categories":["SPFx"],"contents":"Introduction Here the deal: I am lazy. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to have to remember to switch to the right version of Node.js every time I open an SPFx solution in VSCode. I want it to be automatic. I want it to be lazy.\nThis solution works in Windows, but I am sure you can adapt it to other platforms.\nThe problem When you open an SPFx solution in VSCode, you need to make sure you are using the right version of Node.js. If you don\u0026rsquo;t, you will get a nasty error message.\nAnd every version of SPFx potentially requires a different version of Node.js. If you manage multiple SPFx solutions, you may need to switch between different versions of Node.js several times a day.\nSure, you can look up the appropriate version of Node.js for every version of SPFx, and load it when you open a solution (and there is a great resource to do so). But that is a lot of work. And it is boring. And I am lazy.\nAnd even if you are not as lazy as I am, it takes extra time, and potentially leads to errors.\nAnd, technically, you can only have one version of Node.js installed at once. So you need to uninstall the current version, and install the new version.\nThe solution Use a node version manager The solution is to use a node version manager. A node version manager allows you to switch back and forth between versions of Node.js without uninstalling and re-installing.\nThere are several options, but the two most popular ones are nvm, nvs and Volta.\nI use nvs (I\u0026rsquo;ll explain why in a second), but the instructions below should work with the other version managers as well.\nnvs is a cross-platform version manager, and it is easy to install. The best part, however, is that you don\u0026rsquo;t need to have administrator access to your workstation to install it, and you don\u0026rsquo;t need to have administrator access to install new versions of Node.js. This is important if you are working in a corporate environment where you don\u0026rsquo;t have administrator access to your workstation.\nThe only downside is that nvs forgets what version of Node.js you\u0026rsquo;re using every time you open a new command prompt. But that\u0026rsquo;s kinda the point, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nBut again, feel free to use whatever version manager you want. I\u0026rsquo;m not judging.\nAssociate a version of Node.js with a solution The next step is to remember which version of Node.js you need for each solution. You can do this by creating a .nvmrc file in the root folder of your solution. The .nvmrc file is a simple text file that contains the version of Node.js you want to use for that solution. Most version managers understand how to use this file.\nTo generate the .nvmrc file, you can use the following command:\nnode -v \u0026gt; .nvmrc This will create a .nvmrc file in the root folder of your solution, containing the version of Node.js you are currently using.\nIt looks a little bit like this:\nv20.6.0 You can also write 20.6.0 without the `v`` letter, it\u0026rsquo;ll will work just fine.\nOnce your .nvmrc file is created, you can use the following command to load the right version of Node.js:\nnvs use For nvm, you\u0026rsquo;d use the following command:\nnvm use It\u0026rsquo;ll magically look up the version of Node.js you need, and load it for you.\nNote to Windows and nvs users if you get an error message saying that your version string is invalid, it may be due to the way that Windows encodes files. Use the following command to fix the file encoding:\n[string]::Join( \u0026#34;`n\u0026#34;, (gc .nvmrc)) | sc .nvmrc Automatically load the right version of Node.js when you open a solution Now that you have a version manager installed, and you have associated a version of Node.js with your solution, you need to make sure that the right version of Node.js is loaded when you open a solution in VSCode.\nTo do this, I prefer to use solution settings in VSCode. Solution settings are stored in a .vscode folder in the root folder of your solution. You can create a settings.json file in that folder, and add the following setting for PowerShell and nvs:\n{ \u0026#34;terminal.integrated.profiles.windows\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;PowerShell\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;source\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;PowerShell\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;icon\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;terminal-powershell\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;args\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;-NoExit\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;-Command\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;nvs use\u0026#34; ] } } } Feel free to update the command to use the version manager of your choice.\nThe .vscode file is usually ignored by GitHub, so you\u0026rsquo;ll have to look for it in the .gitignore file, and remove it.\nIf you use nvm, you can use the VSCode extension that automatically loads the right version of Node.js when you open a solution.\nConclusion There you go. Now you can be as lazy as I am, and automatically load the right version of Node.js when you open an SPFx solution in VSCode.\nCould I have use other approaches? Sure. But this one works for me.\nWhat about you? How do you manage multiple versions of Node.js?

I mean, how can I not?!\nI made a backup of my site. Set up my new site, and decided that it was a good time to review and update my site\u0026rsquo;s look and feel, and content.\nBut first, I had to prepare for the Microsoft 365 Conference in December, then the one in April.\nOf course, my WordPress subscription expired while I was in Vegas, and my old content wasn\u0026rsquo;t moved. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll get to it when I get home\u0026rdquo;, I foolishly told myself.\n\"I'll get to it when I get home\"\rA foolish me\rBut, shortly after I got home, I heard the good news that I got the new job of Community Program Manager for Power Pages (which was not yet announced).\nBetween then and my official start date in my new role, I\u0026rsquo;d have to start planning from my old role as a Senior Cloud Solution Architect; I\u0026rsquo;d also be helping (albeit in a non-official capacity) prepare for the launch of the new Microsoft Power Pages Community.\nOh, and somewhere during that whole time I was busy helping with the creation (and the migration) of the Microsoft 365 Platform Community Blog, adding development containers to the [SPFx Web Parts repository], and working on some new Sharing is Caring sessions.\nBut things are finally getting back to normal \u0026ndash; a little.\nTwo weeks ago was my first day in my new role. I had to travel to Seattle (for the first time in over 10 years) so I could meet my new team.\nCame back last week. Tested positive for COVID. Rested \u0026ndash; probably more than I have in many, many years \u0026ndash; and now I\u0026rsquo;m fixing my blog while fighting a fever (the pink elephants are telling me I\u0026rsquo;m doing a fine job, by the way).\nI\u0026rsquo;ll do my best to migrate all my old content \u0026ndash; starting with the most frequently-visited content first \u0026ndash; and keep the original URLs the same.\nBut until then, thank you for being patient.\nAlso, thank you for reaching out to tell me that my blog is down. I knew that people visited my blog (because I saw the traffic stats), but I never quite realized that those \u0026ldquo;visitors\u0026rdquo; on my site stats were from real people in the community.\nAnd I certainly never expected to receive so many messages from people telling me that they always rely on my site for so many things.\nFor something that started as a place to leave notes for myself, I am quite flattered that others find my ramblings useful.\nThank you!

If you want to get out of it to do your demo, you have to hit Esc, and Alt-Tab to your demo. Then you have to go back to your presentation, restart the slide show (and often restart at the first slide by mistake).\nUgh!\nYou usually end up fighting with Alt-Tab (and potentially reveal to your audience what other applications you\u0026rsquo;ve got running and/or show your private chats to the world \u0026ndash; like I\u0026rsquo;ve done), or end up showing your presentation in PowerPoint without using the slide show (I\u0026rsquo;m looking at you, Microsoft employees!)\nIn today\u0026rsquo;s post, I\u0026rsquo;ll explain how you can use the slide show mode and make it easy to switch back and forth between your demo and your presentation.\nAs a bonus, I\u0026rsquo;ll show you how you can also keep Teams open and monitor the chat window as you present.\nUsing Presenter Mode in PowerPoint First things first: use the slide show mode!!!. When you present to your audience, you\u0026rsquo;re competing for their attention and trying to get them to focus on what you\u0026rsquo;re showing. They\u0026rsquo;re already fighting to stay awake and will probably look at everything on your slides. If you\u0026rsquo;re just showing your slides in PowerPoint without the slide show mode, you\u0026rsquo;re making harder on your audience to focus and stay engaged. They see all the slides in your deck (\u0026ldquo;Oh my god, he\u0026rsquo;s got 37 slides! We\u0026rsquo;ll never get out of here!\u0026rdquo;), all the ribbons and buttons (\u0026ldquo;Ooh, I wander what the Design Ideas button does?!\u0026rdquo;), and you make the content on your slides smaller.\n(Just so we\u0026rsquo;re clear: this is not cool!)\nDon\u0026rsquo;t you want to be respectful to your audience and save them from boredom? They certainly want you to!\nTo launch your PowerPoint presentation in slide show mode, you just need to hit F5 from anywhere in your presentation. It\u0026rsquo;ll start your slides full-screen (unless you use a custom slide show, but that\u0026rsquo;s another story).\nIf you want to start from the current slide you\u0026rsquo;re editing, you can simply hit Shift-F5.\nTo get out of the slide show mode, hit Esc.\nSo far, this is probably obvious to you (except, maybe, if you\u0026rsquo;re a Microsoft employee, who apparently forget about the F5 key as soon as they join Microsoft 😊).\nThe hard part comes next: how to you easily switch between your slide show mode to your demo (without getting out of your slide show)?\nUsing Desktops As it turns out, the solution is built-in into Windows 10: just use desktops.\nTo get to desktops, just hit the Task View from your task bar.\nYou should begin with only one desktop. To create a new one, select + New desktop at the top of the Task View.\nOnce you have created your new desktop, your task view will allow you to switch back and forth between desktops.\nTo switch between desktops quickly, just use Ctrl-Win-→ and Ctrl-Win-← to go to your next or previous desktops.\nNow that you know how to switch between desktops, let\u0026rsquo;s set them up for your presentation.\nSetting up the desktops I like to set up my desktops as follows:\nThe Default desktop is where I\u0026rsquo;ll run PowerPoint from. The Demo desktop is where the code that I\u0026rsquo;ll demo will be running from. NOTE: You can rename the desktops from the task view by clicking on their names and typing a new name\nDuring my presentation, I\u0026rsquo;ll launch PowerPoint is slide show mode on the default desktop; when I\u0026rsquo;m ready to show the demo, I\u0026rsquo;ll switch to my demo desktop without leaving the slide show mode!\nFor example, in this screen capture below, I go from my PowerPoint slide (which says \u0026ldquo;Demo\u0026rdquo;) to the web page containing the web parts I am demoing.\nSometimes I\u0026rsquo;ll add another desktop to pre-load Visual Studio Code, or one for each of my clients where I place all my windows related to a client so I don\u0026rsquo;t have to close all my apps before I start presenting.\nAll you need to do is to send your apps from the task view to another deskop.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how\nFrom the Windows task bar, start the task view From the task view, right-click on an app you want to move between desktop Select Move to\u0026hellip; and select the name of the desktop where you want the app to appear. In my case, I\u0026rsquo;ll select Demo. That\u0026rsquo;s it!\nKeeping Teams visible on all desktops There is one disadvantage to using desktops: if you use Teams to connect to a meeting and watch the meeting video and/or chat window, and Teams is on your default desktop, it disappears when you switch to another desktop.\nThankfully, David Warner II \u0026ndash; who is the master of presentation tips \u0026ndash; there is a way you can make Teams (or any other apps) appear on all desktops, regardless of which one is currently displayed.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\nForm the task view, right-click on Teams (or the app you want to appear on all desktops) From the context menu, select Show this window on all desktops (or, if you want the window and all the pop-up chat windows and other dialog, select Show windows from this app on all desktops) When you switch desktops, Teams will remain visible!\nConclusion I hope that you\u0026rsquo;ll find slide show mode and desktops useful when doing your presentations.\nDo you use desktops in any other creative ways?

I tend to be very verbose.\nThis is a summary of my much longer GitHub cheat sheet for PnP contributions, but without all the explanations.\nIf you need help to get started, I suggest you read the full article.\nOtherwise, enter your information below and we’ll automatically generate all the GitHub commands you need to get started on a PnP contribution.\nCustomize this article This article will automatically change the instructions to reflect the parameters you enter below.\nVariable Value Original Repository(Upstream) Your GitHub username Start branch name(default is main) Branch name Step 1: Fork repository In your browser go to the repository where you want to contribute (https://github.com/pnp/sp-dev-fx-webparts). In the upper right corner, select the Fork button\nGitHub will automatically begin the forking process. You get a cute little animation showing that it is \u0026ldquo;copying\u0026rdquo; the repository, and you end up in your own copy of the repository.\nYou’ll know that you’re in a fork because the owner will have changed to you, and it should say \u0026ldquo;forked from …\u0026rdquo;\nStep 2: Clone repository From your computer, launch whatever tool you like to run Git commands. Some people like Git Bash, but I prefer Cmder or the Node.js command prompt.\nMake sure that your command prompt is in the directory where you’ll want to create your local repositories. I like to use c:\\github. You can do so by typing:\ncd \\github\rThe repository you will clone will be created a directory within your current directory. To clone the repository, type the following:\ngit clone https://github.com/[your_github_username]/sp-dev-fx-webparts.git\rIt should create a directory with the same name as your repo, then should download all the files locally to that directory.\nOnce your local repo is created, change to the new directory by typing:\ncd sp-dev-fx-webparts\rTo link your local repo with the original upstream repo, you’ll type the following:\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/pnp/sp-dev-fx-webparts.git\rBefore you start making changes, you should make sure that you have the latest version from the original upstream repository by typing:\ngit fetch upstream\rStep 3: Create a branch To create your branch, follow these steps:\nUpdate your local repository with the latest changes from the upstream repository by typing the following:\ngit pull upstream main:my-feature\rNow we’ll let your forked origin repo know about the new branch you’ve created by typing:\ngit push origin my-feature\rSwitch to the new branch you’ve created by typing the following:\ngit checkout my-feature\rNow you’re ready to contribute!\nSummary of commands — steps 2-4 Here are all the commands from steps 2-4. You can just copy and paste all the lines below and run them all at once.\ngit clone https://github.com/hugoabernier/sp-dev-fx-webparts.git\rcd sp-dev-fx-webparts\rgit remote add upstream https://github.com/pnp/sp-dev-fx-webparts.git\rgit pull upstream main:my-feature\rStep 4: Contribute Now that you have your own branch, you can make the changes you need. Please make sure you follow the Microsoft Open Source code of conduct.\nIf you aren’t sure about the code of conduct, you can also check out the Code of Conduct FAQ.\nOnce you’re done making your changes, you’ll want to push your contributions.\nStep 5: Push your changes You can do so by following these steps:\nFrom the local branch folder, type:\ngit add .\rCommit your changes by typing:\ngit commit -v -a -m \u0026quot;Initial commit\u0026quot;\rPush your changes to your origin repository, as follows:\ngit push origin my-feature\rSummary of commands — step 5 Here are all the commands from this step . You can just copy and paste all the lines below and run them all at once.\ngit add .\rgit commit -v -a -m \"Initial commit\"\rgit push origin my-feature\rStep 6: Submit a pull request When you’re ready, open your pull request by following these steps:\nUse your browser to go to: .\nYou’ll be prompted to confirm the branches you want to merge, with an arrow going from one branch to another. Make sure that the arrow is pointing from your branch on your forked repo to the branch on the remote repo. If you follow all the steps above, you should also see Able to merge.\nProvide a descriptive title for your pull request. For example, My feature Most PnP repositories have a pull request template. Please be courteous and follow the template instructions. Follow the prompts and answer as much as possible. If there are sections that say \u0026gt; _(DELETE THIS PARAGRAPH AFTER READING)_, delete them. When you have filled the template, click Create pull request. Remember that the people who review — and ultimately approve or reject — your pull request are often volunteers who are most likely bombarded with notifications from GitHub on top of their every-day jobs. Filling the template will make it easier for them to process your pull request faster.\nAfter you’ve completed your pull request, you’ll see that its status is marked as Open\nAll you have to do now is to wait for your pull request to be merged.\nIt can take a few days, sometimes weeks before your pull request is approved. Please be patient; Most reviewers are volunteers and have a day-to-day job.\nWhile you’re waiting, you can start a new contribution!\nStep 7: Repeat If you want to continue making contributions, you simply create a new branch from the original base branch. For example, if you were created the second update to your my-feature, you could call your next branch my-next-feature.\nCustomize this article Enter the name of the next branch you want to create, and we’ll update the instructions for you:\nVariable Value Next branch name To create your next branch, follow these steps:\nType the following:\ngit pull upstream main:my-next-feature\rPush your new branch by typing:\ngit push origin my-next-feature\rFinally, switch to your new branch by calling:\ngit checkout my-next-feature\rOnce your next branch is created, continue contributing as you did before (contribute, push your changes, submit a pull request).\nSummary of commands — step 7 Here are all the commands from this step . You can just copy and paste all the lines below and run them all at once.\ngit pull upstream main:my-next-feature\rgit push origin my-next-feature\rgit checkout my-next-feature\rDeleting your branch Once your pull request has been approved and merged to the main, you can delete your branch. Do not delete your branch before it has been approved — just in case you need to make a change to your pull request before it has been approved.\nTrust me on this one.\nConclusion I hope that this article will make it easier for you to contribute to PnP repositories.\nUpdates July 2, 2022: Updated default branch to main April 26, 2021: Updated to use PnP instead of SharePoint GitHub organization April 21, 2020: Thanks to Daniel Westerdale for pointing out that I had made a mistake in my code.

I was useless today: my internet was down for most of the day and I was powerless.\nI tried to make myself useful by writing blog posts that I have been meaning to write for a long time (it has been a long time, hasn\u0026rsquo;t it?!).\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re like me, you probably have a bazillion accounts on various Microsoft 365 tenants. I have one for each of my clients, sometimes two (one is a regular user, one is an admin user), plus one for each of my developer tenants, my MVP tenant, and one for when I collaborate with the nicest, most hard-working MVP that I know.\nI have already shared how to use Edge profiles to log on to different tenants and even how to add custom images for each profile, but today I\u0026rsquo;ll show you the next step: creating shortcuts to launch an instance of the Edge browser as a different profile.\nIf you use an Elgato Streamdeck, I\u0026rsquo;ll also show you how you can create keys to launch your browser as a different profile from your Streamdeck.\nCreating a shortcut to launch Edge as a different profile For these instructions, I\u0026rsquo;ll assume that you already have more than one profile on Edge. If you don\u0026rsquo;t, please follow my instructions and come back when you\u0026rsquo;re done. I\u0026rsquo;ll be right here.\nI recently moved to a new computer and I haven\u0026rsquo;t migrated all my accounts yet, but I\u0026rsquo;ll the profiles that I already have set up as an example.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say that I want to create a shortcut to launch the browser to my Warner.Digital tenant. I\u0026rsquo;d use the following steps:\nBefore we start, we need to know the location of the shortcut we want to create. The shortcut we need consists of three components: [path to your Edge executable] [profile flag] [url]. I usually open a file in Notepad to write down my shortcut path. The first part is easy: you want to find where the Edge executable is installed on your computer. It is most likely \u0026quot;c:\\program files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge.exe\u0026quot;, but we\u0026rsquo;ll confirm it in the next step. The second part of your shortcut is the profile flag. It usually consists of the following: --profile-directory=\u0026quot;Your profile directory\u0026quot;. To find your profile directory, follow these steps: Launch Edge under the profile you wish to use. I\u0026rsquo;m going to use my Warner Digital one for this example While running as the Edge profile you want, in the address bar, type: edge://version and hit Enter In the page that appears, you should find the path to your Edge installation under Executable path, and the path to your profile, under Profile path. NOTE: You may be tempted to use the value from Command-line, but it always points to the wrong profile path \u0026ndash; at least in the version of Edge that I\u0026rsquo;m currently using.\nYou only need the last part after the last \\ of your Profile path. For example, my profile path is D:\\Users\\hugoa\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Edge\\User Data\\Profile 4, so I\u0026rsquo;ll use Profile 4 We have what we need for the first two parts of your shortcut! My shortcut to launch my Warner Digital profile would be \u0026quot;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge.exe\u0026quot; --profile-directory=\u0026quot;Profile 4\u0026quot;. Note that if your profile path has any spaces in it, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to use double quotes (\u0026quot;), like I did in mine. If you just want your shortcut to open to a blank tab (or whatever is your default start page for that profile), you don\u0026rsquo;t need to add anything else. However, if you want to launch a particular URL, just add a space, followed by whatever URL you want. For example, to launch SharePoint in the Warner Digital tenant, I\u0026rsquo;d use: \u0026quot;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge.exe\u0026quot; --profile-directory=\u0026quot;Profile 4\u0026quot; https://warnerdidigal.sharepoint.com Once you have your shortcut path ready, you can use whatever approach you want to create the shortcut. If you want to create shortcuts for your Elgato Streamdeck, just use the path as is (see below). To create a new Windows shortcut, use these steps: In Windows, go to the location where you want your shortcut to be created and select New \u0026gt; Shortcut In the Create Shortcut dialog, you\u0026rsquo;ll be prompted to enter the location of the new item. , just past your new shortcut path and select Next Give your new shortcut a name, for example I used Warner Digital and select Finish. That\u0026rsquo;s all you need! You should be able to add the shortcut to your Start Menu, your task bar, or anywhere on your desktop.\nCreating Shortcuts to open Teams (web-based) using different profiles This is so easy, it probably doesn\u0026rsquo;t warrant a section, but I\u0026rsquo;ll say it anyway: you just need to need to make the URL portion of your shortcut https://teams.microsoft.com.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it.\nSo, to open Teams in my Warner Digital profile, my shortcut would be: \u0026quot;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge.exe\u0026quot; --profile-directory=\u0026quot;Profile 4\u0026quot; https://teans.microsoft.com\nCreating a shortcut to call/chat with someone using Teams on a specific profile Also pretty easy, but I thought I\u0026rsquo;d share. Just make the URL portion of the shortcut https://teams.microsoft.com/l/chat/0/0?users=, followed by the email address of the user (or users) you want to chat with.\nFor example, to chat with David Warner, I\u0026rsquo;d use: \u0026quot;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge.exe\u0026quot; --profile-directory=\u0026quot;Profile 4\u0026quot; https://teams.microsoft.com/l/chat/0/0?users=david.warner@fakeemail.com\nTo chat with David Warner and Luise Freese, I\u0026rsquo;d use: \u0026quot;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge.exe\u0026quot; --profile-directory=\u0026quot;Profile 4\u0026quot; https://teams.microsoft.com/l/chat/0/0?users=david.warner@fakeemail.com,luise.freese@fakeemail.com\nLaunching a regular meeting using a profile Just like the previous tips, this one is pretty straight forward. Copy the URL from the join link of a Teams meeting, and add it as the URL portion of your shortcut.\nFor example, if I wanted to join the bi-weekly SPFx special interest group community call using my regular profile, I\u0026rsquo;d use: \u0026quot;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge.exe\u0026quot; --profile-directory=Default https://aka.ms/spdev-spfx-call-join\nBONUS SECTION: Putting it all together on an Elgato Streamdeck I have a 15-key Elgato Streamdeck and I really enjoy it. I should probably get myself the XL Stream Deck one of these days\u0026hellip;\nOne thing that many people don\u0026rsquo;t know (I myself learned it from David Warner, who is the king of gadgets) is that you can create folder buttons on your Streamdeck. Your folder can contain a different set of buttons \u0026ndash; or even more folders!\nTo create a folder in Stream deck:\nLaunch your Stream Deck application In the right pane, search for folder and select Create folder from the Stream Deck group Drag the Create folder icon to a blank button on your Stream Deck. After you drop the Create folder icon on a button, it will create a new folder for you. While the new button is selected, you can edit the folder\u0026rsquo;s title or icon, if you wish. If you click on the newly created folder, it will open into the new folder where you can add new buttons or more folders. You can also click on the back arrow icon (on the top left button in the folder) to go back one level. Theoretically, you could create an infinite number of folders with buttons\u0026hellip; so the possibilities are endless.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how I use my Streamdeck. I\u0026rsquo;m sure there are plenty of other ways to set it up, but this is how I like to set mine up:\nAt the root, I have folder for Edge profiles, one for Teams instances, and one for regular Meetings\nIn my Edge folder, I have all my most frequently used profile. The ones I use for my clients and my personal tenants.\nIn my Teams folder, I have all my frequent Teams clients that I use.\nAnd, finally, in my Meetings folder, I have all the join links for all my regular meetings, as well as some frequent chat buttons.\nOf course, I make sure to select fun icons so I can easily identify which button is for what meeting \u0026ndash; complete with a warrior horse animated GIF for the General Microsoft 365 Special Interest Group bi-weekly call, because: Chris Kent.\nYou may wonder: why wouldn\u0026rsquo;t I just create a folder for each client/team I work with and put my Edge, Teams, and meetings buttons in each client folder? Sometimes I work with more clients than I have buttons available, and I still want to have enough room to have my ZoomIt, PowerPoint presentation, light control, and sound control buttons :-(\nConclusion I hope that this will help you making the most of shortcuts with Edge profile.\nDo you use Edge profile in creative ways?

Since I started presenting regularly on the PnP community calls and the demos are posted on YouTube, I reached out to Andrew Benson (who does an amazing job editing and publishing the videos) for his help with a demo checklist that I can use to improve the quality and consistency of my demos.\nI hope that this checklist will help someone else preparing for their technical demos.\nLet’s get one thing straight, though: I’m not sharing this list because I think I’m an awesome presenter (I’m not), but because I hope that it’ll help others who — like me — are on a continued journey to improve their presentation skills.\nIf you have other tips you’d like to share, feel free to use the comments section.\nGetting your environment ready Headset PC fans are noisy. When you use a microphone, the fan sound is often picked up by the microphone.\nUnless you’re a professional broadcaster with a fancy microphone, you should use a headset.\nHeadsets are great because they keep your microphone a constant distance from your mouth.\nIf you use a wireless headset, make sure it is charged before your presentation. Alternatively, use a wired headset so you don’t have to worry about batteries.\n(I use a Jabra Evolve 75, which seems to be adequate for me)\nMicrophones Internal In a pinch, you can use your built-in microphone on your computer, but keep in mind that you’ll sound far away, and your microphone will pick up every sound in the room. When I review old demos I did with my Surface Studio 2’s built-in microphone, I can hear when I move my mouse and my keyboard clacking as I type on it.\nExternal According to Andrew, you should use XLR – vocal/speech microphones. Avoid using USB mics because of the lousy sound quality.\nIf you’re going to buy a microphone, here’s Andrew’s recommendations from low cost to higher end:\nShure SM57/58 ($100) Shure SM7B / ElectroVoice RE20 ($400-$500) AT4050 / Neumann TLM 102 ($600-$800) Neumann U87 ($3,000+) Speakers If you aren’t using a headset, make sure that your speakers aren’t too loud so that you don’t generate echo when you speak.\nVideo camera Internal Your built-in PC camera is probably adequate — just make sure that you elevate your PC so that the audience can get a straight view of you (instead of a view of inside your nostrils).\nExternal 720p or 1080p HD is plenty — no need for 4k. Teams does not conference or stream 4K, so your picture quality will be lowered to 1080p anyway.\nAndrew recommends a 1080p webcam with a built-in tripod so you can position the camera on a stable surface rather than straddling on your unstable laptop screen.\nBackground While they are cool, avoid using background effects. You should strive to appear as real and natural as if you were in the same room. With backgrounds, you often appear like a cut-out. With that being said, my office is also used for storage, so I always have a background on.\nMost importantly, it makes it a lot harder to subtly cut and splice videos when you use background effects.\nScreen resolution If you’re going to be demoing something, your screen resolution is pretty important.\nLet’s put it plainly: it does not matter whether you use 720p or 1080p; the key is to use a 16:9 ratio.\nHere is a list of resolutions that will provide a 16:9 ratio:\nResolution Examples Dimensions Wide XGA (WXGA-H) Minimum, 720p HDTV 1280×720 Full HD (FHD) 1080 HDTV (1080i, 1080p) 1920×1080 Wide Quad HD WQHD Dell UltraSharp U2711, Dell XPS One 27, Apple iMac 2560×1440 Wide QXGA+ (WQXGA+) HP Envy TouchSmart 14, Fujitsu Lifebook UH90/L, Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro 3200×1800 4K Ultra HD 1 (4K UHD-1) 2160p, 4000-lines UHDTV (4K UHD) 3840×2160 8K Ultra HD 2 (8K UHD-2) 4320p, 8000-lines UHDTV (8K UHD) 7680×4320 Please note that if you use a higher resolution, you need to make sure that all font sizes are big enough for everyone in the audience to be able to read your text.\nWhen using a browser, make sure that your app resolution is at 100%.\nWhen presenting in PowerPoint, make sure to use the Presenter mode, which will render your presentation at 100% resolution and use your full screen.\nTo use the presenter mode, hit F5 to start from the first slide, or SHIFT-F5\nTheme Yes, yes, dark theme is cool. But when it comes to presenting — especially if you’re showing code in Visual Studio Code / Visual Studio — use a light theme.\nCreating your demo You have a very short period of time to convey your message. If you’re demoing during one of the PnP community calls, you typically have between 10 to 15 minutes to do your demo.\nCreate your story Try to explain to your audience why they should care about your demo; present the current state, then your \u0026ldquo;improved\u0026rdquo; state so that people can quickly understand what’s in it for them.\nOnce you have introduced yourself (see below), show a demo as quickly as possible. Or, at least, show a teaser that will keep your audience interested.\nResist the urge to talk for 10 minutes about your code without showing your demo or your audience will get bored and fall asleep.\nMake sure that you’re able to answer the audience’s \u0026ldquo;what’s in it for me?\u0026rdquo;\nCreate your companion deck You don’t need to create a huge PowerPoint presentation here; just something that provides your name, title, and contact information.\nYou might need a slide to explain your usage scenario or to show the before/after pictures.\nIf you want to, you can include an architecture diagram — but it is often unnecessary.\nAvoid using transition and animations. They don’t show well on Teams and/or YouTube videos.\nPrepare your code walk-through If you’re going to show code, it’s a good idea to create screen shots of your code in PowerPoint and highlight the important sections.\nI know, you may think that it is cooler to show code directly in Visual Studio Code/Visual Studio, but it invariably results in blurry code as you scroll around and move your mouse around.\nPlus: it forces you to think ahead of time about what code you want to show.\nCreate your resources list You should wrap up your companion deck with a demo summary and reference slides. It’s a good idea to provide a link to your source code.\nTake the time to include links to the articles, blog posts, previous demos that you may refer to during your demo.\nCreate your \u0026ldquo;oh shit\u0026rdquo; deck No matter how simple your demo is, you should always prepare for the eventuality that everything will go wrong.\nDo a dry run of your demo and take screen shots throughout so that if the demo gods are not playing nice, you’ll have something to show.\nIf you’re preparing for a PnP call demo, David Warner II — who does a screenshot summary of every PnP call — will most likely contact you to ask if you have any slides before you’re scheduled to present. Make sure to include your screenshot slides.\nCreate the metadata for your demo If you’re doing a demo for a PnP call, it will be recorded and posted on YouTube. You may want to write a 100-word description for your demo title, description. Make sure to include the tools or technologies you used if that’s what your demo is about.\nPrepare for the Q\u0026amp;A Be ready! People may ask about compatibility, licensing, availability, why you used this approach instead of another one, etc.\nGet permissions If you’re demoing work that you did for a customer, you should obtain a written permission from them before you mention them and/or show their solution. Otherwise, make sure to make to sanitize or otherwise make your demo so that nobody gets in trouble.\nGiving your demo Demo day checklist Cue up your demo and load your presentation Create your virtual desktops (see below) Confirm that you are a presenter (the agenda for PnP calls is usually published in advance on social media) Find out which presentation slot is yours — but be prepared to present sooner Fifteen minutes before the call:\nTurn off notifications (trust me on this one!); if using Windows 10, consider turning on Focus assist\nSet your phone to mute Sign-in to the Teams call. While you do, make sure to test your audio and video. While on the call, check the participants list to make sure that you’re a presenter.\nTest your audio/video before everybody signs in When it is your time to demo:\nTake control of your presentation (hit the Share tray icon) Make sure to present your PowerPoint in presentation mode Close the meeting control box (the one in the lower right corner that shows the meeting video) Confirm that you’re being seen and heard Introduce yourself; don’t mention the time of the day (remember that your demo will be recorded and available on-demand for months to come) Stick to your script (except for the Q\u0026amp;A portion at the end) Don’t prompt for questions; They’re handled through the chat window. If you choose to answer a question from the chat window, make sure to restate the question before giving the answer (the chat window doesn’t show up on recordings) Relinquish control Mute yourself after your demo Answer questions in the chat window. Demo tips Use ZoomIt When you want people to focus on something on the screen, it’s always a good idea to zoom in or highlight the screen in some way.\nLuckily, there’s free tool by Microsoft called ZoomIt which is designed to help during presentations.\nAfter you install ZoomIt, you can use these useful shortcut keys to enable ZoomIt features:\nShortcut key Function Ctrl-1 Begin Zoom-In mode Ctrl-2 Begin drawing (while not zoomed in) ↑ Zoom In ↓ Zoom Out Left-Click Begin drawing (while zoomed in) R, B, Y, G, O, P Change pen color to red, blue, yellow, green, orange, purple Ctrl-↑ Increase pen size Ctrl-↓ Decrease pen size E Erase ESC Stop zoom Tab Draw ellipse (while drawing) SHIFT Draw a straight line (while drawing) CTRL Draw a rectangle (while drawing) SHIFT+CTRL Draw a rectangle (while drawing) T Type (while zoomed in) If you want to see cool demos using ZoomIt, take a look at presentations by David Warner II.\nThere are other cool features you can use (like timers, blanking the screen, etc.). I recommend you take visit the ZoomIt site for more information.\nUsing multiple desktop When you’re in PowerPoint presenter mode, it can be hard to switch to your desktop to show your demo, and switch back. It’s like PowerPoint doesn’t want to stop presenting, or it doesn’t want to back to presenting…\nI like use Windows 10’s Desktop functionality to create multiple desktops. With multiple desktops in Windows, you can assign which \u0026ldquo;desktop\u0026rdquo; you want the application to appear in. While you’re showing a desktop, only the applications from that desktop will show up. When you switch to another desktop, it hides the applications from the previous desktop and shows applications from the current desktop only.\nI usually have a Work desktop (so I can work while waiting for the call), a Demo desktop (where I show the application I’m going to demo), and a Presentation desktop, where I have PowerPoint in presentation mode.\nTo use multiple desktops, follow these steps:\nLaunch PowerPoint and Teams From the taskbar, select Task view \u0026gt; New desktop +. Alternatively, you can use WIN-Ctrl-D In the new desktop, launch the apps you want to use while demoing. Launch your browser and/or Visual Studio Code, for example. Cue your browser to your demo page. When you’re ready to switch between desktops, use Ctrl-WIN-→ and Ctrl-WIN-← to go to the next/previous desktop If you need to see all your desktops (to rename or re-organize them), you can use WIN+Tab. The great thing is when you’re sharing your desktop in Teams, it shows the content your monitor sees — regardless of which desktop shows.\nConclusion I hope that this checklist will help you prepare for your demo.\nIf you’re looking for inspiration, take a look at these demos which follow the format discussed above:\nChris Kent (DMI) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5tGR6Eh_Jo, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Q_itkE0Uk David Warner (Catapult Systems) \u0026amp; Hugo Bernier https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9P6kGECklI Hugo Bernier https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWrvC-0HF4A Paolo Pialorsi (PiaSys.com) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8Jkj2NUAEc Niket Jain (Microsoft) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIAJ2_Md8xI Markus Möller (Avanade) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4NXi-p2fEw Wictor Wilén (Avanade) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc9S270c-Dg Sudharsan Kesavanarayanan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndHMdfFscsk I hope this helps?\nPhoto credits Image by Rudy and Peter Skitterians from Pixabay\n","permalink":"https://tahoeninja.blog/posts/my-demo-checklist-for-pnp-calls/","tags":["PnP"],"title":"My Demo Checklist for PnP Calls"},{"categories":["VS Code"],"contents":"Introduction If you’re an SPFx developer who uses Visual Studio Code, you may have noticed that the JSON files that the Yeoman generator creates contain comments to help you understand how to configure your manifest.\nThe only problem is: JSON files aren’t supposed to have comments. And Visual Studio Code likes to remind you of that when it sees comments in a JSON file.\nFor example, when you open the manifest for your brand new SPFx web part, you’ll find these nasty error messages:\nAn example of schema validation errors caused by comments\nI’m one of those people who can’t stand any validation errors or warnings. I know, I know, I’m weird. But it drives me insane!!!\nLuckily, Paul Schaeflein has a solution that he Tweeted this morning:\nTired of the squigglies in the SPFx configuration files? Add this to your Workspace settings (.vscodesettings.json):\n\u0026ldquo;files.associations\u0026rdquo;: {\n\u0026ldquo;*.json\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;jsonc\u0026rdquo;\n}\n— Paul Schaeflein (@paulschaeflein) August 12, 2020\nIn this super-quick post, I’ll show how to configure your Visual Studio Code to stop showing validation errors for comments in JSON files.\nPaul Schaeflein deserves all the credit for this. I’m just giving you step-by-step instructions.\nConfiguring JSON files to accept comments From Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:\nFrom the menu, go to File | Preferences | Settings In the User preferences tab, expand the Text Editor section and select Files In the Associations setting, select Add Item In the new row, enter the following values: Under Key enter *.json Under Value enter jsonc Select OK to add your entry That’s it! Now you should be able to go to your manifest file and enjoy the squiggle-less JSON with comments!\nAhhh, no more schema validation errors!\nWhat unholy magic is this? Few people know that if you save your .JSON file as a .JSONC file, you won’t get validation errors. That’s because .JSONC stands for \u0026ldquo;JSON with comments\u0026rdquo;.\nHowever, you can’t rename your schema files in an SPFx solution to .JSONC because SPFx expects .JSON files — not .JSONC.\nPaul’s \u0026ldquo;hack\u0026rdquo; simply associates .JSON files with the .JSONC schema. That way, Visual Studio Code treats every .JSON file as a .JSONC — regardless of the extension.\nThank You Thanks Paul Schaeflein for this tip!

I’ve already written about how to configure multiple in a previous post, so I won’t repeat myself here.\nTo keep track of who you’re currently logged on as, Edge displays a profile picture on the upper-right corner.\nYou can configure a different picture for every profile in your browser, but you’re limited to two choices:\nThe profile picture associated to your Microsoft 365 tenant (if you’re signed in with a Microsoft 365 tenant); or One of the cute avatar images that come with Edge\nUnfortunately, there isn’t a choice for custom profile pictures.\nI was collaborating with David Warner II this evening, solving world problems, when we suddenly got distracted with fixing an issue with one of his profiles.\nIn the process of fixing his browser issues, I discovered a way to change my profile images.\nI searched for this and didn’t find anything, and I definitely don’t know if this is a supported feature or not, but I thought I’d share with you how I did it.\nChanging your profile picture Here’s how to do it:\nUsing Edge Chromium, switch to the profile for which you wish to set up a custom profile image. Make sure that it already has an image (if not, click on your profile, select Manage profile settings | … | Edit | Change Picture ) From the address bar, type edge://version From the About version page that shows up, look for Profile path. Copy the path that’s displayed next to it (it should be something like C:\\Users\\hugoa\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Edge SxS\\User Data\\Profile 1) Launch a file explorer and navigate to that path. (I use [Windows]+[R] to launch the Run… dialog and paste the path). In the list of files that appear, look for one called Edge Profile Picture.png and make a backup copy of it. Find whatever custom image that you’d like to use, resize it to 424×424 pixels, and save it as Edge Profile Picture.png Close your browser and your new profile picture should show up\nConclusion That’s it! I have now configured all my profiles to use the corporate logo of every tenant I have so that I easily tell which profile is currently in use.\nLet me know if you found a better way to do this.\nI hope this helps?\nPhoto credit Image by Andre Mouton from Pixabay\n","permalink":"https://tahoeninja.blog/posts/adding-custom-edge-profile-images/","tags":["Microsoft Edge"],"title":"Adding custom Edge profile images"},{"categories":["Microsoft List"],"contents":"Introduction Over the last few years, Microsoft has done an amazing job at modernizing SharePoint.\nIt used to be that the first question my clients would ask me when I would start a new engagement was \u0026ldquo;How can we make SharePoint not look like SharePoint?\u0026rdquo;.\nNow, most engagements start with \u0026ldquo;How can we make our old SharePoint sites look more like the new SharePoint sites?\u0026rdquo;.\nThat’s a testament to the hard work of folks at Microsoft. They’ve changed how you edit SharePoint pages and sites to make it easier for everyone to quickly design beautiful content.\nBut lists in SharePoint have not changed at the same pace. Sure, they got a slightly updated look and feel (well, some lists, anyway), but they were still not easily approachable for every user.\nWith Microsoft Lists, Microsoft seems to be doing to Lists what the SharePoint team did to pages. They are modernizing them and making them much easier to use for everyone.\nThey’re still lists behind the scenes, but they’re no longer relegated to being hidden in a site somewhere. They’re becoming first-class citizens in Microsoft 365, crossing the boundaries of SharePoint, Groups, and Teams.\nI already covered the lists templates, but in today’s post, I’ll explain how you can easily build rules to to notify someone, and how rules will continue to evolve to do a lot more.\nNOTE: As per my previous post on Microsoft Lists, much of this is speculation based on Microsoft marketing materials, demos, and videos. I’m like one of those people who watch trailers for Marvel Movies frame-by-frame to get as many spoilers as possible, but for Microsoft marketing videos :-). Actual functionality may be different once this feature is fully released.\nCreating a rule Here are the steps to create a rule:\nFrom within you list, go to the Automate menu and select + Create a rule\nFrom the Create a rule pane, select the rule trigger you wish to use\nYou’ll notice that — at this time — the only options are to Notify someone when. The way this panel is done, it looks like they’ll be adding more rules in the future though. Depending on the trigger you select, you’ll get a nice conversational interface with an easy \u0026ldquo;fill-in the blanks\u0026rdquo; sentence that makes it easy to configure your rule. Rules are very simple: they all follow a \u0026ldquo;if/then\u0026rdquo; format. This is when you select A column changes\nThis is when you select A column value changes to something\nA new item is created\nAn item is deleted\nFill the blanks with the values you want\nThe most \u0026ldquo;complicated\u0026rdquo; one seems to be A column value changes to something, which asks you to Choose a column, Choose a condition and a Enter a value. Note that when \u0026ldquo;fill-in-the-blank\u0026rdquo; sections are related, you need to fill the first part before you call fill the next one. For example, you need to Choose a column before you can Choose a condition, and the Choose a condition field needs to be filled before you Enter a value. That’s presumably to (eventually) give different condition choices when you pick different types of columns, I guess.\nEmail fields allow you to enter multiple values and seem to resolve the email address to people, if available. Also, you can refer to other columns on the list item. For example, if you have a column called Speakers, you can select Speakers instead of entering an email there.\nOnce you’ve filled in the blanks, select Create to create the rule. When the rule is created, it will display the Manage Rules pane with your new rule created.\nEditing a rule From the Manage rules pane (Automate | Manage rules ), select the rule you wish to change. In the Edit rule pane, you get the same fill-in-the-blanks fields that you got when you created the rule, but now they contain the values you selected when you created the rule.\nTo delete the rule, select the Delete rule button at the bottom of the pane.\nOtherwise, select Save to update your rule and return to the Manage rules pane. Note that you can also temporarily disable a rule from within the Manage rules pane and selecting the toggle to turn a rule off.\nWhy put rules under Automate? By the looks of it, the Automate menu will eventually become the place for other cool automation features.\nFor example, if you add a date field in your list, you’ll see a Set a reminder option show up (my list has a Date reported field).\nWhen you have an item selected, the list of choices under Automate seems to change as well:\nConclusion The overall look and feel of rules in Microsoft Lists is a very user-friendly interface that seems to be designed to grow. Every aspect, from how the menu is constructed to how the configuration panels are configured are built to continue adding new functionality in the future without adding complexity.\nIn general, I like the new visual feel of Microsoft Lists and the style they’re using for configuring rules, column formatting, etc. I think that every day users will also feel more comfortable exploring the features too.\nI hope that you’ll enjoy Microsoft Lists and rules when they become available. I certainly hope to find out if my frame-by-frame analysis of screenshots, demos, and videos proved to be correct.\nAre rules enabled in your tenant yet? I’d love to know!\n(Sigh) I really need a hobby!\nFor more information A first look at Microsoft Lists Microsoft Lists ","permalink":"https://tahoeninja.blog/posts/working-with-rules-in-microsoft-lists/","tags":null,"title":"Working with rules in Microsoft Lists"},{"categories":["SPFx"],"contents":"Introduction Since SPFx 1.8, we have been able to make web parts aware of what section they reside in on a modern page.\nEach SharePoint site theme has four variants: the main variant, a neutral variant, a soft variant, and a strong variant.\nYou can configure each page section’s background color with one of the four theme’s variants.\nWhen you place a web part on a section with a different background color, the web part has the ability to adapt to that section’s background color.\nMicrosoft has a great article explaining how to add section support to your web parts, but it does not go into great detail explaining the theme variants.\nTheme variants define a lot of different colors, like the background color, body color, button colors, etc.\nEvery time I write a web part that is \u0026ldquo;theme-variant-aware,\u0026rdquo; I find myself looking up which theme colors I should use for each element in my web part.\nIf you dig enough in the SharePoint code (under sp-component-base) you’ll find helpful comments describing how to use each color of a theme variant.\nHoping this will help someone, I extracted the description of each color in theme variants from the comments and created this post.\nKeep in mind that this information may change between versions of SPFx. I’ll do my best to keep it up-to-date between versions.\nAdding support for theme variants Before we explore the various colors that are available at your disposal, let’s discuss how to make your web part aware when a section theme variant changes.\nWhen you create a new web part using the Yeoman generator, your web part does not adapt to theme variants. If you change the background color of the section where you web part resides, it mostly stays the same color, like the sample below:\nTo make it support theme variants, you need to follow these steps (this code is extracted from Microsoft’s article:\nIn your web part’s .manifest.json, add the following (I usually add it above the preconfiguredEntries):\n\u0026ldquo;supportsThemeVariants\u0026rdquo;: true,\nAt the top of your web part’s code (YourWebPartNameWebPart.ts, add the following imports:\nimport { ThemeProvider, ThemeChangedEventArgs, IReadonlyTheme, ISemanticColors } from \u0026#39;@microsoft/sp-component-base\u0026#39;; In your web part class (just below export default class YourWebPartNameWebPart, add these two variables:\nprivate _themeProvider: ThemeProvider; private_themeVariant: IReadonlyTheme | undefined; The _themeProvider variable will store the web part’s instance of the theme provider, which notifies the web part of the currently selected theme. The _themeVariant variable will store the currently selected theme variant.\nAdd an event handler in your web part to react to changing theme variants:\nprivate _handleThemeChangedEvent(args: ThemeChangedEventArgs): void { this._themeVariant = args.theme; this.render(); } In your web part code, add an onInit method to initialize the theme provider, get the initial theme variant, and associate the event handler:\nprotected onInit(): Promise\u0026lt;void\u0026gt; { // Consume the new ThemeProvider service this._themeProvider = this.context.serviceScope.consume(ThemeProvider.serviceKey); // If it exists, get the theme variant this._themeVariant = this._themeProvider.tryGetTheme(); // Register a handler to be notified if the theme variant changes this._themeProvider.themeChangedEvent.add(this, this._handleThemeChangedEvent); return super.onInit(); } In your web part’s render method, you’ll need to add code to pass the theme variant to your component:\npublic render(): void { const element: React.ReactElement\u0026lt;IYourWebPartNameProps \u0026gt; = React.createElement( YourWebPartName, { themeVariant: this._themeVariant, // whatever other props you want to pass } ); ReactDom.render(element, this.domElement); } In your web part’s component’s props (IYourWebPartNameProps), add a prop for the theme variant:\nimport { IReadonlyTheme } from \u0026#39;@microsoft/sp-component-base\u0026#39;; export interface IYourWebPartNameProps { themeVariant: IReadonlyTheme | undefined; } Finally, in your web part’s component’s tsx file, you can use the themeVariant prop to retrieve variant colors:\npublic render(): React.ReactElement\u0026lt;IYouWebPartNameProps\u0026gt; { const { semanticColors }: IReadonlyTheme = this.props.themeVariant; return ( \u0026lt;div style={{backgroundColor: semanticColors.bodyBackground, color: semanticColors.bodyText}}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span className={ styles.title }\u0026gt;Welcome to SharePoint!\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p className={ styles.subTitle }\u0026gt;This web part is theme variant aware.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } Once your rebuild your web part (gulp build) and add your web part to a page (remember: if you changed the manifest since you added the web part to a page, you need to re-add the web part), your web part will now be aware of section background colors:\nYou’ll notice that we use the bodyBackground and bodyText colors from the themeVariant. But theme variants define a lot more colors.\nTheme variant colors In a theme variant, you can find the palette colors (e.g.: themeDark, themePrimary, themeSecondary, etc.) and the semantic colors.\nYour first instinct might be to try to use the palette colors, but that would require you to know exactly which color is applied to what element. For example, do you know which palette color is used for a button’s background color when a user mouses over it?\nMe neither.\nThe semantic colors, however, describe how you would use each palette color semantically. For example, it tells you that the background color of a hover button should be buttonBackgroundHovered.\nHere is the full list of semantic colors available within a theme variant. The list is extracted from Microsoft’s code.\nBase colors Color Description bodyBackground The default color for backgrounds. bodyStandoutBackground The standout color for highlighted content backgrounds. For highlighted content when there is no emphasis, use the neutral variant instead. This should be a shade darker than bodyBackground in light themes, and a shade lighter in inverted themes. bodyFrameBackground The color for chrome adjacent to an area with bodyBackground. This can be used to provide visual separation of zones when using stronger colors, when using a divider line is not desired. In most themes, this should match the color of bodyBackground. bodyFrameDivider Used as the border between a zone with bodyFrameBackground and a zone with bodyBackground. If bodyBackground and bodyFrameBackground are different, this should be the same color as bodyFrameBackground in order to visually disappear. bodyDivider Divider lines; e.g. lines that separate sections in a menu, an \u0026lt;HR\u0026gt; element. disabledBackground The color of the outline around focused controls that don’t already have a border; e.g. menu items variantBorder The color of the border that provides contrast between an element, such as a card, and an emphasized background. variantBorderHovered Hover color of border that provides contrast between an element, such as a card, and an emphasized background. defaultStateBackground Background color for default/empty state graphical elements; e.g. default icons, empty section that needs user to fill in content, placeholder graphics, empty seats, etc. errorBackground The background for errors, if necessary, or highlighting the section of the page where the error is present. blockingBackground Background for blocking issues, which is more severe than a warning, but not as bad as an error. warningBackground Background for warning messages. warningHighlight Foreground color for warning highlights successBackground Background for success inputBorder The border of a large input control in its resting, state; e.g. the box of a dropdown. smallInputBorder The border of a small input control in its resting unchecked state; e.g. the box of an unchecked checkbox. inputBorderHovered The border color of a large hovered input control, such as textbox. inputBackground The background color of an input, e.g. textbox background. inputBackgroundChecked The background of a checked control; e.g. checked radio button’s dot, checked toggle’s background. inputBackgroundCheckedHovered The background of a checked and hovered control; e.g. checked checkbox’s background color on hover. inputForegroundChecked The foreground of a checked control; e.g. checked checkbox’s checkmark color, checked toggle’s thumb color, radio button’s background color around the dot. inputFocusBorderAlt The alternate focus border color for elements that already have a border; e.g. text field borders on focus. buttonBackground Background of a standard button buttonBackgroundChecked Background of a checked standard button; e.g. bold/italicize/underline text button in toolbar buttonBackgroundHovered Background of a hovered standard button buttonBackgroundCheckedHovered Background of a checked and hovered standard button; e.g. bold/italicize/underline text button in toolbar buttonBackgroundDisabled Background of a disabled standard button buttonBackgroundPressed Background of a pressed standard button; i.e. currently being clicked by mouse buttonBorder Border of a standard button buttonBorderDisabled Border of a disabled standard button primaryButtonBackground Background of a primary button primaryButtonBackgroundHovered Background of a hovered primary button primaryButtonBackgroundPressed Background of a pressed primary button; i.e. currently being clicked by mouse primaryButtonBackgroundDisabled Background of a disabled primary button primaryButtonBorder Border of a primary button accentButtonBackground Background of an accent button (kicker) menuBackground The background of a menu. menuDivider The divider between menu items. menuIcon The default colors of icons in menus. menuHeader The headers in menus that denote title of a section. menuItemBackgroundHovered The background of a hovered menu item. menuItemBackgroundPressed The background of a pressed menu item. menuItemText The text color of a menu item. menuItemTextHovered The text color of a hovered menu item. listBackground The background color for the entire list. listText The default text color for list item titles and text in column fields. listItemBackgroundHovered The background color of a hovered list item. listItemBackgroundChecked The background color of a checked list item. listItemBackgroundCheckedHovered The background color of a checked and hovered list item. listHeaderBackgroundHovered The background color for a hovered list header. listHeaderBackgroundPressed The background color for a pressed list header.

Very exciting! ","permalink":"https://tahoeninja.blog/posts/getting-to-know-microsoft-lists/","tags":null,"title":"Getting to know Microsoft Lists"},{"categories":["SPFx"],"contents":"Introduction I was recently working on a custom meganav SPFx solution for a client who reported that one of the links in the navigation would always produce the following error:\nNotFoundError: Failed to execute 'removeChild' on 'Node': The node to be removed is not a child of this node.\rin t in div in div in t in CustomizedPageLayoutScrollRegion in div in article in t in t in o in t in t in t in t in t in section in div in div in t in Styledt in t in o in t in t in t\rI immediately assumed that one of the many application extensions on the page were causing the issue.\nSince the target of that link was a modern page, I assumed that there was something different on that page that would cause the issue.\nBut after removing all custom extensions on the site collection where that page resided, removing all custom web parts, and even starting with a blank modern page, I still got the error.\nI eventually solved the issue, but it was a frustrating process.\nIn this post, I’ll explain how I solved the issue.\nI hope it will save you from having to search like I did.\ndata-interception=\u0026ldquo;off\u0026rdquo; When you navigate between SharePoint modern pages, there is usually a lot of stuff that is repeated on each page; stuff like navigation, suite bar, headers, footers, etc.\nIn fact, for most pages, the only thing that changes is the content area. It does not make sense for SharePoint to re-load everything on the page — that’s just a waste of valuable bandwidth.\nSo SharePoint uses a page router to efficiently refresh only the parts of the page that change when you navigate between pages.\nIn most cases, that’s a good thing.\nExcept when you try to do navigate between pages from a custom SPFx solution. Especially if you open your links to a new browser tab or a new browser window.\nThe page router will cause SharePoint to ignore target attributes on your hyperlinks and produce weird errors like the one I got.\nAnd the problem is: your error may be completely different from mine, making it practically impossible to find a solution to this problem.\nAs it turns out, there is an article about this on the SharePoint development documentation.\nAll you need to do is to add data-interception='off' to your anchor tag to tell SharePoint not to intercept your page navigation and to bypass the page router.\nSo, instead of this:\n\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://yoursite.sharepoint.com/sites/hr/SitePages/benefits.aspx\u0026quot; target=\u0026quot;_blank\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Benefits\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\rUse this:\n\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://yoursite.sharepoint.com/sites/hr/SitePages/benefits.aspx\u0026quot; target=\u0026quot;_blank\u0026quot; data-interception='off'\u0026gt;Benefits\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\rOf course, once you figure out to use data-interception, you’ll find that the amazing Julie Turner, Elio Struyf, and Corey Roth all blogged about this before.\nConclusion In summary: SharePoint ignores your anchor tags’ target attributes because it uses a page router to make things more efficient, which causes the issue. Adding data-interception='off' will tell SharePoint not to mess with how to navigate to your pages.\nI have never experienced this issue because I always convince my clients not to open hyperlinks in new tabs, unless the links point to non-web documents — in which case you should use new tabs. Read this article if you want to know why.\nI have learned over the years that ultimately, it is up to the client to decide what they want to do… even if it is the wrong thing to do. My job is to give them the relevant information they need to make an educated decision — even if I don’t agree with their decision.\nI also learned that any time I have a problem, I should always check Julie Turner’s blog first because she often has the answers I’m looking for.\nI hope this helps?\nPhoto Credit Photo by Agence Olloweb on Unsplash\n","permalink":"https://tahoeninja.blog/posts/data-interception/","tags":["SPFx","Data interception","Mystery solved"],"title":"Solving the “Failed to execute ‘removeChild’ on ‘Node'” error on modern SharePoint pages"},{"categories":["SPFx"],"contents":"Introduction Dear blog, how I’ve missed you! How long has it been? I know, I know, I’ve been insanely busy, I wasn’t ignoring you, I swear.\nAs you know, I like to use this blog as a series of \u0026ldquo;Note to self\u0026rdquo; notes so that I can find the things I tend to look for more often than I’d like.\nToday’s post is another \u0026ldquo;Note to self\u0026rdquo;. It isn’t intended to be the best way or the only way to do this, it is my way.\nIf, like me, you use the PnP Yeoman Generator to create your SPFx projects, you have the ability to turn on Stylelint when generating your projects.\nStylelint is a tool that reports bad code (or smelly code) in your CSS (and SCSS) files. It helps enforcing consistent code and prevents you from making errors in your style sheets.\nHowever, I use a few super-useful switches in my SCSS that always produce an error when running stylelint.\nThey’re perfectly valid pseudo-classes, but stylelint likes to warn you about them — probably because you shouldn’t abuse them.\nIn today’s post, I’ll show you how I use these pseudo-classes, and how I configure stylelint in my projects to stop these errors.\nNOTE: I simplified some explanations to keep this article short(ish). If you know the inner workings of how SCSS, CSS, CSS Modules, and Stylelint works, you’ll have to forgive my creative license. But then again, if you know how these things work, this article is probably not for you 🙂\nWhy bother? I can’t tell you how many SPFx projects I’ve opened run gulp build on and was bombarded with errors and warning… and when I reached to the developers who created the project, they said \u0026ldquo;Oh, I just ignore all that!\u0026rdquo;.\nThe warnings (and errors) are there to tell you that something is wrong (or potentially wrong) with your project; if you ignore them, you might let an issue slip by unnoticed.\nUsing linting in your projects helps you become a better developer, and it helps keep your code clean and consistent — so that if someone else has to maintain your code, they can get comfortable with your code pretty quickly (presuming that they’re also using linting tools).\nIn my opinion, it is every developer’s job to constantly improve the quality of their code and to improve themselves. I’m not smart enough to know all the best practices, so I rely on linting tools to help me become better.\nDon’t ignore warnings. Fix them, or — once you’ve decided to accept the warning — change your project settings so that you can get a clean — warning free — build.\nThe :global switch I’ve already written about the :global pseudo-class before, so I’ll keep it short.\nWhen you use .scss files for your style sheets in a SPFx project, the SASS pre-processor creates unique names for all your CSS classes. It does this to ensure that the CSS from your components does not interfere with the CSS from other components. This is also know as local scope.\nBut sometimes you need to define CSS class names that can’t change. For example, if you’re embedding a third-party component and you need to override their style sheet. That’s when you want your CSS classes to be global scoped.\nAnd that’s exactly what :global is does.\nFor example, if I wanted to style a .ms-DocumentCard element inside my component, I’d use:\n:global(.ms-DocumentCard) { border: 2px solid red; } Be careful though: :global changes apply globally. If you use :global(.ms-DocumentCard) in your style sheet, it will affect every single .ms-DocumentCard on the entire page.\nTo override styles within your web part, use something like this:\n.yourWebPart { :global(.ms-DocumentCard) { border: 2px solid red; } } To define a whole area of your .scss that you don’t want to be renamed, use a :global block, like this:\n:global { .ms-DocumentCard { border: 2px solid red; .ms-DocumentCard--compact { .ms-DocumentCardPreview { -ms-flex-negative: 0; flex-shrink: 0; width: 144px; } } .ms-DocumentCardPreview-icon img { width: 32px; height: 32px; } } .ms-DocumentCard:not(.ms-DocumentCard--compact) { ... } } The only problem is: stylelint will yell at you at build time:\nUnexpected unknown pseudo-class selector \u0026quot;:global\u0026quot; selector-pseudo-class-no-unknown\rThat’s because the :global is not a valid pseudo-class in CSS, it is a CSS module switch.\nAs far as stylelint is concerned, :global has no business in CSS… and it’s probably a good thing: you should be careful when using the :global switch because you could completely mess up every page your web part is on if you’re not careful.\nIf you promise to be careful, though, here’s how you can tell stylelint that you’re ok with using the :global switch in your .scss and that you promise to use it for good, not evil:\nIn the root of your project, find the .stylelintrc file and open it. The .stylelintrc is where you can configure the stylelint rules.\nPRO TIP: If you’re using Visual Studio Code, it most likely doesn’t know that your .stylelintrc file is a .json file. Just go in the lower-right corner of VS Code, click on Plain text:\nIn the list of files types that pop-up at the top, select JSON with comments\nFind the \u0026quot;rules\u0026quot; node, and insert the following JSON at the bottom — making sure to add a comma (,) at the end of the previous rule:\n\u0026#34;selector-pseudo-class-no-unknown\u0026#34;: [ true, { \u0026#34;ignorePseudoClasses\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;global\u0026#34; ] } ], Save the file and rebuild. Your .stylelintrc file should look something like this:\n{ \u0026#34;extends\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;stylelint-config-standard\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;plugins\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;stylelint-scss\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;rules\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;at-rule-no-unknown\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;scss/at-rule-no-unknown\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;selector-pseudo-class-no-unknown\u0026#34;: [ true, { \u0026#34;ignorePseudoClasses\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;global\u0026#34; ] } ], } } The :export pseudo-selector Call me old-fashioned, but I like to keep my styles completely separate from the presentation layer and the business/data layers.\nFor this reason, I always try to avoid store any colors, fonts, or dimensions in my .tsx files, and stick them in my .scss files.\nBut sometimes I need to access some values from my .scss in my code. For example, if I need to dynamically change colors of elements, or if I need to know the dimensions of an element.\nIn this case, I would define the values in my .scss (because that’s where styles belong!), and use :export to make them available to my code:\n:export { backgroundColor1: rgba(75,192,192,0.4); borderColor1: rgba(75,192,192,1); pointBorderColor1: rgba(75,192,192,1); pointBackgroundColor1: rgba(75,192,192,1);; pointHoverBackgroundColor1: rgba(75,192,192,1); pointHoverBorderColor1: rgba(220,220,220,1); } And:\n:export { centerPadding: 50px; } And then, in my code, import the styles like I normally would:\nimport styles from \u0026#39;./LineChartDemo.module.scss\u0026#39;; And call the exported values as needed in my code:\nlet color: string = styles.backgroundColor1; But you’ll soon find out that stylelint does not like the :export pseudo-selector. Again, that’s because as far as stylelint is concerned, anything that starts with : is a pseudo-class.\nTo solve this, simply add the following rule in your .stylelintrc:\n\u0026#34;selector-pseudo-class-no-unknown\u0026#34;: [ true, { \u0026#34;ignorePseudoClasses\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;export\u0026#34; ] } ], How to figure out what rules to put in? When stylelint gives you an error, it usually tells you what rule was broken.\nFor example:\nUnexpected unknown pseudo-class selector \u0026quot;:export\u0026quot; selector-pseudo-class-no-unknown\r…tells you that selector-pseudo-class-no-unknown is the rule that causes this error.\nGo to the stylelint user guide and find the rule that is causing the issue. Then look for the optional secondary options section to see if there are any configuration settings that allow you to override the settings.\nIn the case of selector-pseudo-class-n-unknown, it says that you can pass an array of class names to the ignorePseudoClasses setting, as follows:\nignorePseudoClasses: [\u0026#34;/regex/\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;] So, all you need to do is to pass the values you want to ignore (in our case export and global) in a string array:\n\u0026#34;selector-pseudo-class-no-unknown\u0026#34;: [ true, { \u0026#34;ignorePseudoClasses\u0026#34;: [ export\u0026#34;, global\u0026#34; ] } ], } Conclusion I hope that using CSS module switches and stylelint configurations in your projects will help keep your projects clean and warning free.\nUpdates June 16th 2020: Thanks to Stefan Bauer for pointing out I was incorrectly describing :global and :export as pseudo-classes, when they are really CSS module switches. That explains why I can never find any information about them when I google them.

During his demo, he demonstrated that he added the web part version in the property pane.\nUnfortunately, Bo didn’t get to share his code, but it is something that I also like to do in my production web parts.\nIn this article, I’ll share my approach for showing the solution version in your web part.\nI’m sure Bo’s code is much cooler than mine, but this is the method I use.\nWhere is the version number stored? NodeJS projects have a version number which is stored in your project’s package.json. It follows the semantic versioning guidelines, which consists of a major, minor, and patch version.\nSharePoint solutions, however, use a different versioning scheme, which consists of a major, minor, patch, and a revision number.\nStefan Bauer does a great job at explaining the differences between the two types of versioning.\nThe SharePoint solution version that SharePoint displays when you show Details about a web part is stored in src\\package-solution.json in your project. This is an example of the version format that SharePoint uses:\nSyncing the NodeJS package version with the solution version I like to keep the NodeJS version in sync with the SharePoint solution. But I really dislike copying the version numbers manually.\nI may have mentioned once or twice that I’m the world’s laziest developer — if I can avoid to do anything more than once, I try to avoid it.\nFortunately Stefan also has a great solution to automatically synchronize the NodeJs package version to your SharePoint package solution version every time you build the solution.\nIf you use the PnP SPFx Yeoman generator, there is already a gulp task that will execute every time you run npm version.\nIf you use the regular SPFx Yeoman generator — not the PnP one — you can achieve the same thing by adding a custom gulp task written by Stefan.\nYou can do the same thing by following these steps:\nIn your SPFx solution, edit your gulpfile.js\nFind the following line:\nbuild.initialize(require(\u0026#39;gulp\u0026#39;)); Insert the following code before the line you found in step 2.\n// This section is inspired by Stefan Bauer\u0026#39;s article at https://n8d.at/how-to-version-new-sharepoint-framework-projects/ // Stefan rocks! let syncVersionsSubtask = build.subTask(\u0026#39;version-sync\u0026#39;, function (gulp, buildOptions, done) { this.log(\u0026#39;Synching versions\u0026#39;); // import gulp utilits to write error messages const gutil = require(\u0026#39;gulp-util\u0026#39;); // import file system utilities form nodeJS const fs = require(\u0026#39;fs\u0026#39;); // read package.json var pkgConfig = require(\u0026#39;./package.json\u0026#39;); // read configuration of web part solution file var pkgSolution = require(\u0026#39;./config/package-solution.json\u0026#39;); // log old version this.log(\u0026#39;package-solution.json version:\\t\u0026#39; + pkgSolution.solution.version); // Generate new MS compliant version number var newVersionNumber = pkgConfig.version.split(\u0026#39;-\u0026#39;)[0] + \u0026#39;.0\u0026#39;; if (pkgSolution.solution.version !== newVersionNumber) { // assign newly generated version number to web part version pkgSolution.solution.version = newVersionNumber; // log new version this.log(\u0026#39;New package-solution.json version:\\t\u0026#39; + pkgSolution.solution.version); // write changed package-solution file fs.writeFile(\u0026#39;./config/package-solution.json\u0026#39;, JSON.stringify(pkgSolution, null, 4), function (err, result) { if (err) this.log(\u0026#39;error\u0026#39;, err); }); } else { this.log(\u0026#39;package-solution.json version is up-to-date\u0026#39;); } done(); }); let syncVersionTask = build.task(\u0026#39;version-sync\u0026#39;, syncVersionsSubtask); build.rig.addPreBuildTask(syncVersionTask); ``` That’s it. Now, next time you run a gulp build, the Stefan’s gulp task will make sure both versions are in sync.\nChanging the version number To change the package version of your solution, you can simply edit the package.json version.\nBut npm has a command to easily change your package version. You can call any of the following commands from your SPFx solution folder:\nnpm version major\rnpm version minor\rnpm version patch\r…to change the major, minor, and patch version — respectively — in your package.json.\nWhen to change major, minor, and patch version I often see two extremes: either developers leave their solution versions at 1.0.0 no matter how many times they change their code, or they semi-randonmly change the version number every time they change their code.\nLuckily, semantic versioning (or semver) provide guidelines on how to change your package versions.\nYou should pretty much always start at version 1.0.0, and increase the major, minor, and patch versions depending on the types of changes you made.\nThe following table shows when you should call which npm version command, depending on the types of changes you’re making to your solution:\nType of change Stage Versioning rule Example version NPM command First release New solution Start with 1.0.0 1.0.0 npm version major Backward compatible bug fixes Patch release Increment the third digit 1.0.1 npm version patch Backward compatible new features Minor release Increment the middle digit and reset last digit to zero 1.1.0 npm version minor Changes that break backward compatibility Major release Increment the first digit and reset middle and last digits to zero 2.0.0 npm version major Using the manifest version Probably the easiest way to display the version number is to use the version property of the web part’s manifest which is available in the web part’s context, for example:\nconst version: string = `Version: ${this.context.manifest.version}`; Unfortunately, the version number that comes from the manifest is a 3-digit version (major.minor.patch), whereas the version number in your SharePoint solution is a 4-digit version.\nNow, that’s perfectly fine if you don’t use the 4th digit (the revision) in your SharePoint solution version numbers, or if — like me — you sync your package.json version with the package-solution.json. You can simply add an extra .0 at the end of the version from this.context.manifest.version.\nIf you want to get the 4-digit version number, however, it gets a little more complicated…\nImporting the version number using a static import To get the 4-digit version from your SharePoint solution, you’ll need to import the version number that’s found in the package-solution.json in your code.\nYour first instinct might be to simply add an import statement to your code and point to your project’s config/package-solution.json, like this:\n// Static import import * as packageSolution from \u0026#39;../../../config/package-solution.json\u0026#39;; But — depending on the version of TypeScript you’re using –you’ll likely get a nasty error:\nError - [tsc] src/webparts/versionDisplay/VersionDisplayWebPart.ts(21,34): error TS2732: Cannot find module '../../../config/package-solution.json'. Consider using '--resolveJsonModule' to import module with '.json' extension\rYou could add \u0026quot;resolveJsonModule\u0026quot;: true to your solution’s tsconfig.json, but I have found that it doesn’t consistently work — depending on which version of TypeScript you’re using.\nInstead, I use the following steps:\nIn your project’s src folder, add a file called typings.d.ts\nPaste the following code to your newly created file:\ndeclare module \u0026#34;*.json\u0026#34; { const value: any; export default value; } In your code add a static import to your package-solution.json (you may have to adjust the path to the file depending on where in your code you’re adding your import)\n// Static import import * as packageSolution from \u0026#39;../../../config/package-solution.json\u0026#39;; When you want to display the version number, use the following code:\n(\u0026lt;any\u0026gt;packageSolution).solution.version Importing the version using require You can also use a require statement, by following these steps:\nIn your code, where you want to insert the version number, insert this code:\n// Import package version const packageSolution: any = require(\u0026#34;../../../config/package-solution.json\u0026#34;); (Again, the path to your `package-solution.json` may vary depending on where you’re adding the code) When ready to show the version number, you can simply use:\npackageSolution.solution.version Displaying the version number in the property pane To display the version number, I like to use the PropertyPaneWebPartInformation control from the @pnp/spfx-property-controls library.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\nImport the @pnp/spfx-property-controls-library package in your solution by entering the following command in your command-line:\nnpm install @pnp/spfx-property-controls --save --save-exact\rAdd the following import to your web part class:\n// Used to display version information\rimport { PropertyPaneWebPartInformation } from '@pnp/spfx-property-controls/lib/PropertyPaneWebPartInformation';\rIn your web part’s getPropertyPaneConfiguration method, add the following code inside the groups array:\n{ groupName: \u0026#34;About\u0026#34;, groupFields: [ PropertyPaneWebPartInformation({ description: \u0026#34;Version: \u0026#34; + (\u0026lt;any\u0026gt;packageSolution).solution.version, key: \u0026#39;webPartInfoId\u0026#39; }) ] } The full code for my getPropertyPaneConfiguration looks as follows:\nprotected getPropertyPaneConfiguration(): IPropertyPaneConfiguration { return { pages: [ { header: { description: \u0026#34;This web part displays the current version of the solution\u0026#34; }, groups: [ { groupName: \u0026#34;About\u0026#34;, groupFields: [ PropertyPaneWebPartInformation({ description: \u0026#34;Version: \u0026#34; + (\u0026lt;any\u0026gt;packageSolution).solution.version, key: \u0026#39;webPartInfoId\u0026#39; }), ] } ] } ] }; } Note that I didn’t localize the code for simplicity, but please use localized resources instead of hard-coded text.\nWhen you’re done, your web part’s property pane should display the current version number:\nConclusion I know it was a very long explanation for such a simple concept, but our goal was to make sure that we never have to copy the version number of your web part manually.\nWe also learned how to properly version solutions along the way.\nThanks to Bo George for the inspiration to write this article, and Stefan Bauer for writing a custom gulp task that I use in every one of production SPFx solutions.\nYou can find the code for this solution in my GitHub repo.\nI hope this helps?\nUpdate April 1, 2020: After joking with Stefan Bauer that this should be a standard feature in the PnP SPFx Yeoman generator, he pointed out that it is already a feature. Of course, because: Stefan. I updated my article accordingly. April 1, 2020: Ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod! Julie Turner read my blog and reached out to me to point out that I should tell people how to use the this.context.manifest.version before importing the package-solution.json. She’s absolutely right, plus I’m such a big fan of her work. I’ve updated my article accordingly. March 31, 2020: John Sanders suggested that it might be a good idea to add a link to launch the web part maintenance mode, and I really like it. You just need to append ?maintenancemode=true to the page URL to turn the page into maintenance mode. Great idea!

It’ll be useful any time that you have a business process that needs to send a letter, generate a contract, or produce any sorts of documentation that needs to be printed and/or signed.\nPrepare your template The first thing you need is a Word template.\nFor this article, I’ll use a standard Word template, but you can follow my instructions with your own template.\nLet’s get started by using the following steps:\nFrom within Word, select File \u0026gt; New\nFrom the list of templates that are available, search for the template you’d like. For this sample, I’m using Blue curve letterhead because I’m too lazy to write my own template.\nIt will give you a preview of the template. Just click Create to create a new document from that template. If you prefer, you can use a new blank document and copy and paste your existing template. I’m not picky.\nTo insert content dynamically inside your template, you’ll need to create some Content controls. Content controls allow you to define areas within a Word document that you want to make editable. The Blue curve letterhead template already has content controls, but we’ll define some custom ones as well. To insert content controls, you need to use the Developer tab. If you already see the developer tab, skip to step 8.\n. If you don’t see the Developer tab, right-click on a blank area of your Word ribbon, and select Customize the Ribbon…\nIn the Customize the Ribbon and keyboard shortcuts dialog, find the Developer tab on the right side of the dialog (under Customize the Ribbon) and check it, the select OK.\nLet’s insert a custom content control in our template. For this example, we’ll pretend that we want to specify a case number in our letter. From your Word document, find the line between the [Recipient Name], [Street Address, City, ST ZIP Code] and Dear Recipient and insert a new line, then type Case Number:.\nPosition your cursor to the right of Case Number: and, from the Developer tab, select Plain text control.\nYou should see a new content control appear where your cursor was:\nTo change the prompt text for your Case Number placeholder, select Design Mode from the Developer tab\nWord will highlight the content controls in your document. Replace Click or tap here to enter text with [Case Number]. You can also control the text format if you wish to do so.\nIf you’re up to it, replace the placeholder text in the other content controls in your template. 13. To get out of the Design Mode, click it again in the ribbon. The placeholders should hide again. Select the [Case Number] content control and select Properties from the Developer tab. In the Content Control Properties dialog, change the Title to Case Number then click OK.\nRepeat setting the content control properties for all the content controls or they won’t appear as dynamic fields to populate in Power Automate. When your template is ready, you’ll need to save it as a Template (dotx), and you’ll need to save it where Power Automate can find it. I like to store my templates in a SharePoint document library that I’ve pre-created (called Templates — I know, super original). To do so, use the Word File then Save As menu, then select your desired SharePoint site and document library then click Save.\nI named mine Case Letter Template, if you’d like to know.\nOnce your document is saved as a template on a SharePoint site, we’re ready to create the workflow in Power Automate.\nPrepare your Flow Let’s create a Flow in Power Automate.\nIn a real-life scenario, you’d probably want a change in your systems to trigger a document generation — a new record in Dynamics 365, a record change in Common Data Services, or a new record in SharePoint for example.\nHowever, to keep this example simple, I’ll use a simple manual trigger that we can call at any time.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\nGo to https://make.powerapps.com/ In the left navigation, selec Flows From the + New menu, select Instant — from blank. Again, you can choose the best trigger for your own specific needs.\nFrom the Build an instant flow dialog, specify a name (e.g.: Generate Case Letter) and select Manually trigger a flow under Choose how to trigger this flow, then click Create.\nIn your new flow, select + New step.\nIn the Choose an action box, type Word and select Word Online (Business)\nFrom the list of actions that appear, select Populate a Microsoft Word template\nIn the new Populate a Microsoft Word Template action, select the SharePoint site (or Group) where you saved your document, the Document Library where you stored the template, and pick the template from the file picker.\nIf you can’t find the document you’ve saved, make sure it isn’t still open in Word and try changing the site or the Document Library. When you pick the proper template, the action dialog will change to display the various content controls. Note that it displays a dynamic value for each content placeholder you created.\nIn a real production system, you’d probably want to retrieve your template data from your existing systems — like Dynamics 365, Common Data Services, or a database. for this article, we’ll just prompt for it when we launch the workflow. To do so, select the Manually trigger a workflow box to expand it\nFrom the Manually trigger a workflow box, select + Add an input and select Text when prompted to Choose the type of user input\nIn the new Input field that is created, type Address. Repeat adding new inputs for Recipient Name, Case Number, Sender Name and Sender Title\nNote that I’m trying to keep this sample as simple as possible. In real life, I’d probably want to pick the name of the sender from the current context, and I’d get the title from the user’s properties. I’d probably also use a separate field for address 1, city, state, zip. Now go back to the Populate a Microsoft Word template and, for each placeholder, insert the matching dynamic values from the trigger inputs.\nWe’re almost done! In our next step, we’ll store the newly generated document in a SharePoint library.\nSaving the generated document The Populate a Microsoft Word template action generates the document, but it doesn’t do anything with it. It’s up to you to save it somewhere, convert it to PDF, or email it.\nFor our sample, we’ll use the SharePoint Create file action by following these steps:\nBelow the Populate a Microsoft Word template action, select + New step In the Choose an action dialog, type SharePoint and select Create file from the list of possible actions.\nIn the newly created action called Create file, select the Site Address where you want to store the document, and the Folder path for the document library where the newly generated documents will go. For the File Name, use the Case Number dynamic value from the trigger. For the File Content, use the Microsoft Word Document from the Populate a Microsoft Word Template action.\nThat’s it! Now we just need to test the Flow by selecting Save and Test. When prompted to enter values, go ahead and enter some text values and click Run flow\nOnce the flow is finished running, you’ll find a document with a matching case number in your destination library. It should look like this:\nBut what about conditional sections? That’s really all there is to it… but a common question I get is \u0026ldquo;How do I change content of the template based on some conditional values?\u0026rdquo;.\nThe easiest answer is: just use more than one template and create conditional logic in your flow to populate the appropriate template based on whatever rules you want.\nHelp, my content controls don’t show up in the Populate a Microsoft Word Template If you find that your content controls don’t show up after you save your template, I have found that adding a Title to the property control seems to help.\nIf that doesn’t work, make sure you used a Plain text content control and try removing the formatting.\nIf the template doesn’t seem to refresh, try saving your flow, leaving the flow, then editing it again. It will reload the template and should refresh the list of content controls.\nConclusion As you may have noticed, it probably takes longer to create a proper Word template than it does to dynamically populate a document in Power Automate.\nI encourage you to explore the capabilities of the Word Online (Business) connector.\nI hope this helps?\nPhoto Credits Photo by Patrick Fore on Unsplash\n","permalink":"https://tahoeninja.blog/posts/generate-word-documents-from-a-template-using-power-automate/","tags":null,"title":"Generate Word documents from a template using Power Automate"},{"categories":["Power Platform"],"contents":"Introduction When using cloud-based services like Office 365 and the Power Platform, it can be challenging to integrate with your on-premises resources. All of a sudden, your on-premises databases, APIs, file shares, and even your existing on-premises SharePoint infrastructure become impossible to reach. At least, not without making some giant holes in your firewall.\nAt our recent Toronto Citizen Developer User Group meeting, my good friend Luis Duran demonstrated how to use the on-premises data gateway to access a custom web API running on his workstation from Power Automate.\nHe had rehearsed the demo earlier that day from our offices. Still, he had changed many environmental variables by moving his demo to our meetup venue. Luis ran a web API from his workstation, over a different network (the guest wifi at the Microsoft office), using a new IP address.\nLet’s say that if his demo didn’t work, no one would have blamed him. Heck, I tried to run a web API project using a static IP address on my workstation earlier in the day, and I had issues getting it to work.\nBut the demo worked!\n\"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\"\rArthur C. Clarke\rAs Arthur C. Clarke once said: \u0026ldquo;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\u0026rdquo;. In today’s blog post, I’ll explain how to use the on-premises data gateway to access your local resources from the Power Platform.\nMaybe I can prove that the Data Gateway isn’t magic?\nWhat is the On-Premises Data Gateway You have services in the cloud, like Power BI, Power Apps, Power Automated, Azure Analysis Services, or Azure Logic Apps.\nYour data is not in the cloud. It sits on your company’s network behind firewalls.\nThe on-premises data gateway works as a sort of bridge that lets your cloud-based services work with your on-premises data.\nBut it does so securely without requiring you to punch any holes in your firewalls.\nAnd it is fast!\nHow does it work? Do you use some chat app at work? Maybe you use Microsoft Teams or Twitter?\nWhen someone sends you a chat, they’re not connecting directly to your workstation over some obscure port.\nWhen your friend sends you a chat message, they send it to a gateway service that is usually in the cloud.\nThe gateway service then tells your app that you received a new chat message and displays it for you.\nThe chat gateway knows how to reach you because when you signed-in with your chat app, the app contacted the gateway and said, \u0026ldquo;If you need to send me notifications, let me know! I’m right here\u0026rdquo;.\nIt often uses the standard SSL ports (443) to keep prying eyes from intercepting your chat messages from the app to the gateway.\nThe on-premises gateway mostly works the same way. Except that instead of a chat app you install on your workstation, it is a Windows service you install anywhere on your network (e.g., your workstation or a server).\nInstead of chat messages, it receives requests to retrieve data from available resources on that same network. It can also receive requests to update data.\nWhen it launches, your on-premises gateway lets the cloud-based gateway service that it is ready. \u0026ldquo;Hey, let me know if you need any data. I’ll be here!\u0026rdquo;.\nWhen your Power App, Power Automate, or any of the other services needs data, it sends an encrypted request with credentials to the cloud gateway service.\nThe gateway service then sends that encrypted request to your on-premises gateway.\nAnd your on-premises gateway decrypts the request, extracts the credentials, and connects to your data source with those credentials. It sends the query to the data source and, when it gets a response, sends the encrypted results back through the gateway service, which sends it to cloud service that requested the data in the first place.\nMicrosoft has a pretty diagram that explains the concept. I encourage you to read more about how it works on their site:\nImage: Microsoft\nWhat are the requirements? The good news is: you don’t need to punch any holes in your firewalls or anything like that.\nHowever, you shouldn’t install the gateway on any rinky-dink computer. You need at least a 64-bit version of Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012 R2.\nThe machine should always be on and always connected to the Internet. Please don’t install it on a laptop that goes to sleep or puts the network adapter to sleep to save power.\nMicrosoft recommends an 8-core CPU with at least 8 GB of memory and a solid-state drive (SSD).\nTry using a physical network connection over a wireless network.\nThe person installing the gateway on the device must also be the administrator of the gateway. You’ll need to have enough privileges on the computer you’ll be using to be able to install the application.\nYou can only install one type of gateway per computer (yeah, there are more than one types of gateway — we’ll explain later)\nIf you’re planning on using Windows credentials in your data sources, your gateway should go on a domain-joined machine.\nAnd please don’t install the gateway on a domain controller.\nHow do I install a gateway? At the risk of repeating myself: you’ll want to install gateways on computers that are always on and connected to the Internet.\nThe steps below are the same installation steps provided by Microsoft; you should check their instructions to see if they have updated.\nDownload the gateway. You can also download the gateway from any cloud service that supports gateways. For example, in Power Apps, you can go to Data \u0026gt; Gateways \u0026gt; + New gateway.\nLaunch the installer and select Next.\nWhen it prompts you to choose the type of gateway you need, select On-premises data gateway (recommended) and select Next. Like I said earlier, there is another version of the gateway called the \u0026ldquo;personal mode,\u0026rdquo; but it is intended to be used by you and with Power BI only.\nYou may or may not get a warning saying that the gateway should be installed on a computer that is always on. You can just select Next. It’ll prompt you for an installation path and to accept the terms of use. Pretend to read the terms of use and privacy statement, select the checkbox then select Install.\nYou’ll need to enter the Email address to use with this gateway. Use the Office 365 email address who will become the administrator for this gateway, then select Sign in. You’ll probably be prompted to sign-in.\nIf all goes well, it’ll say that you’re signed in. It will ask you if you want to register a new gateway or migrate, restore, or takeover another gateway. Since you’re here, I’ll assume you want to select Register a new gateway on this computer and select Next.\nIt will ask you to enter a New on-premises data gateway name. Make sure to use a unique name that will make it easy to distinguish it from others (i.e., not Gateway). You’ll also be asked for a Recovery key — that’s an 8-character or longer secret you’ll use if you ever need to recover a gateway. You can make up whatever recovery key you want, but make sure you store it somewhere safe! If you were adding a gateway to an existing cluster, this is where you would specify to join the cluster. Feel free to read Microsoft’s instructions to add to an existing cluster if you want. Select Configure.\nIf all goes well, you’ll get a message saying the gateway is online and ready to be used. Yay! Select Close. Since the gateway works with Power Apps, Power Automate, Power BI, and Azure, it’ll show you all which services it connects to. Usually, the Azure service is not connected by default, but you can select Create a gateway in Azure if you want.\nIf all goes well, you should find your gateway in the Power Platform site. For example, in Power Apps, you would go to Data \u0026gt; Gateways in your default environment.\nYou’re done! Now you’re ready to use the on-premises data gateway!\nTo use an on-premises data gateway with a standard connector To use your gateway, just create a connection for one of the gateway-enabled connectors.\nRight now, it works with the following connectors:\nApache Impala DB2 File System Http with Azure AD Informix MySQL Oracle Database PostgreSQL SharePoint SQL Server Teradata To use SQL Server For example, to create a connection in Power Apps, follow these steps:\nLog-in to Power Apps From the left navigation, select Data then Connections Select + New connection\nSelect a connector from the list. For this example, we’ll select SQL Server\nA dialog that is specific to the type of connector will pop-up. Note that, depending on the connector, the option to connect to a gateway may only appear based on what configuration you choose. For example, SQL Server does not let you use a gateway when your Authentication Type is Azure AD Integrated. It makes sense since that option is for cloud-based SQL Server connections.\nTo use a gateway connection, you’ll need to select either SQL Server Authentication or Windows Authentication\nIf you scroll to the bottom of the configuration dialog, you should see an option to Choose a gateway\nIf you didn’t install your gateway yet, you could install it from the link below the Choose a gateway then hit the Refresh icon to show your newly installed gateway. Fill the configuration information (SQL server name, SQL database name, and credentials), then select your gateway and select Create. To use SharePoint Some other connectors may prompt you to select at the start of your connection. For example, if you create a SharePoint connection, the first thing you’ll see is this option:\nAnd if you select Connect using an on-premises data gateway, you’ll get prompted to enter more details:\nIf you scroll to the bottom of the configuration dialog, it’ll prompt you to select a gateway:\nTo use the File System When some connectors only work with on-premises data, you’ll have to select a gateway right away. For example, when creating a connection to your on-premises File System, you’ll get the following dialog:\nAnd if you fill all the configuration details, the last option is to select a gateway:\nUsing a gateway with a custom connector You can also use an on-premises data gateway with custom connectors.\nFor example, let’s say you have an API that is only available within your on-premises network, but you want to call it from within Power Apps or Power Automate. You would follow these steps:\nLog-in to Power Apps From the left navigation, select Data then Custom Connectors Select + New custom connector and pick how you want to define the custom connector. This article is already super-long, so I’ll spare you the details here, but leave a comment if you want more information about how to create a custom connector.\nEventually, you’ll get to the General information step. This is where you select Connect via an on-premises data gateway\nFinish the custom connector steps. You’ll be prompted to select a gateway only when you create a connection with your new custom connector.\nHow to use a gateway connection? Your gateway connections will appear in your list of connections, just like cloud-based connections. You can use them as any other regular connections within your apps.\nIt may not always be obvious that you can connect to an on-premises resource. For example, let’s say you want to create a new Flow with Power Automate that launches when a new file is created on your on-premises SharePoint server. You would follow these steps:\nMake sure to create your gateway first! From within https://make.powerapps.com, select Flows then + New \u0026gt; + Automated — from blank\nIn the dialog that pops up, you would name your Flow and select When a new item is created under SharePoint, and select Create\nYour new Flow will prompt you to select enter a URL to your SharePoint site Site address and select a List Name.\nThis is where it gets tricky: if you enter the URL of your on-premises SharePoint site, Flow may simply tell you ‘Site Address’ is required and ignore the URL you entered.\nThat’s most likely because the default connection for SharePoint actions is for your SharePoint Online instance. You can change your action’s connection by using the … and select your on-premises connection from under My connections\nYou can tell which one is your on-premises connection because its default name will be the name of the user you specified when you created the connection. Once you change your connection, you should be able to enter the URL to your on-premises SharePoint site, and it should work. Note that you can also have multiple SharePoint actions in your Flow, and each one can use a different connection. It could come in handy if you wanted to move files from SharePoint on-premises to your SharePoint online instance, for example.\nHow about support for environments? The Power Platform allows you to define environments to separate your production data from your sandbox, dev, and test data.\nUnfortunately, as of this writing, the on-premises data gateways only work with the default environment on your tenant.\nIf you need to create a Power App or a Flow that use the gateway, they must also be in the default environment.\nIt means that your apps and Flows must also be in the same region as your default environment.\nIt is a serious limitation, and the Power Platform team is aware of this.\nThey’re super busy adding new features all the time, so you can’t blame them if it hasn’t been a priority for them.\nI’m sure that one day they’ll get around to adding support for non-default environments, but until then, feel free to provide them with feedback.\nConclusion They may seem magical, but on-premises data gateways allow you to access your on-premises data from the cloud in a secure way, and it is very fast and easy to use.\nYou should definitely consider establishing some form of governance before you use on-premises data gateways, but that’s a topic for another day.\nI hope this helps?\nThanks Thanks to Luis Duran for doing all the hard work for our user group presentation.

I even made a tiny contribution a while ago, but never got around to doing more.\nKeep in mind that I have to study for two certification exams that I have scheduled over the next two days, I have to review my materials for Office 365 Saturday Redmond 2020, I have to prepare for the upcoming Toronto Citizen Developer User Group meeting, I have a web part that I need to finish with the help of David Warner II, and I need to finish adding Graph integration to my PnP Calendar Control…\n… but other than that, I have some spare time. I took a look at the list of Office 365 CLI issues to look for inspiration and found a request for a new command called get ID of the current tenant.\nWait a minute, I know how to get the tenant ID! I use this trick all the time. And it doesn’t require any code or any tools to be installed.\nSo I thought I should at least share my trick for finding the tenant ID, and if I’m a good boy and do all my work today maybe I’ll treat myself and do a contribution to the Office 365 CLI.\nGetting the Tenant ID I found this trick over 3 years ago in a Stack Overflow discussion and, but it took a little playing around to get it working.\nTo get your tenant id, follow these steps:\nStart with your original tenant name. It should be in the form of [yourtenant].onmicrosoft.com. Do not use your custom domain name, use your original tenant name. If in doubt, use whatever comes before .sharepoint.com on your SharePoint Online site.\nBrowse to https://login.microsoftonline.com/[yourtenant].onmicrosoft.com/.well-known/openid-configuration. Note that you have to replace [yourtenant] with the tenant name you obtained in step 1. Make sure to keep the onmicrosoft.com bit too. This URL is not authenticated, so you should be able to get to it from anywhere without logging in, so you can use something list Postman if you want, but a regular browser will do.\nYou’ll get some JSON back. Don’t worry, you don’t need to speak JSONese, just look for whatever URL comes after \u0026quot;token_endpoint\u0026quot;: . It should start with \u0026quot;[https://login.microsoftonline.com/](https://login.microsoftonline.com/).\nYour tenant ID is the alphanumeric value immediately after \u0026quot;[https://login.microsoftonline.com/](https://login.microsoftonline.com/) and before /oauth2/token\u0026quot;,. For example, if you get this first line:\n\u0026quot;token_endpoint\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;https://login.microsoftonline.com/ef32e188-30ce-4f80-8956-d95598788bdc/oauth2/token\u0026quot;,\ryour tenant ID will be ef32e188-30ce-4f80-8956-d95598788bdc\nThat’s it!\nConclusion I know, I know, some of you will say \u0026ldquo;You can just go to the Azure Admin center and get the directory ID\u0026rdquo; as per Official Microsoft documentation, but it assumes that you have access to the Azure Admin center.\nThe way described in this post works regardless of your permissions, and does not need any tools to be installed on your computer, or any code.\nI hope this helps?\nPhoto Credit Image by Pexels from Pixabay\nUpdates March 2, 2020: Laurent Sittler has an article which shows about 17 different ways to retrieve the tenant ID.

Nowadays, I use Power Automate, but when I started, workflows were not so easy to build.\nThe majority of the projects I worked on had already failed at least once or twice before I join them.\nBy the time I join a project, the team is usually willing to try anything if it means it’ll help them succeed.\nInvariably, when I start digging into the requirements, there is always an over-complicated workflow that must handle every possible scenario known to man.\nThat’s when I tell them the story of how Ohio State University designed the walkways for its campus.\nThe Oval The Ohio State University, founded in 1870, has an incredible 11-acre courtyard that many students and locals believe is the heart of the campus.\nLocals call it \u0026ldquo;The Oval.\u0026rdquo; It is a network of pathways and landscaping and sculptures surrounded by buildings. It is a beautifully inspiring place to hang out, relax, and study.\nThe Oval wasn’t always the way it is today. It began as a place where livestock grazed near the library and the university hall.\nIn 1911, as the story goes, Joseph N. Bradford became the University’s architect.\nHis design for the campus landscaping was a very rigid geometric pattern of walks within the Oval. He wanted a very symmetrical design that would require changing the bordering streets to make the Oval more rectangular.\nUnfortunately (or fortunately for my story), project delays and cost overruns meant that there was no money left to implement Bradford’s full design.\nThe landscaping crew went to Bradford to ask for his revised plans for the campus landscaping.\nIn response, Bradford had the crew join him in a hot-air balloon that rose above the campus.\nFrom such a high viewpoint, they could see the paths that the students had made walking back and forth between the buildings.\nWhere people walked most frequently, the grass had visible indentations. As this was in the winter, the snow made the pathways even more distinctive.\nThe pathways were far from symmetrical. Instead, they showed the most efficient routes between buildings — something that was in itself beautiful and had an organic quality to it.\n\u0026ldquo;There’s your landscaping design! Follow these pathways!\u0026rdquo; said Bradford. He took a selfie of himself and the grounds below and dropped the mike. \u0026ldquo;Bradford, OUT!!!\u0026rdquo;\nOk, that might not be exactly how it happened, but you get the gist of it.\nDesire Paths and workflows A desire path is a path that is formed when people (or animals) choose to walk between points A and B. It often represents the most direct or most convenient way between the source and destination.\nUrban planners often observe drastic differences between their designs and the real-life use of their designs.\nWith modern tools such as Power Automate, it can be very easy to design workflows.\nMaybe too easy sometimes.\nThe first instinct is to design super-complicated workflows that will handle every single possible scenario — regardless of how probable the scenario is.\nSometimes, the best thing to do is to design the bare minimum workflow possible, and then step back and observe how people use the workflows.\nWhere are there exceptions?\nWhere are the delays?\nWhere do people make mistakes?\nDo you find that the workflows start and stop in mid-flow because there is missing information that should have been captured?\nInstead of trying to automate everything from the start, try to handle the most common scenarios. Then try to fix where things break most often, or where the most costly mistakes happen.\nInstead of doing one giant revision of a workflow that will take you and your team months and months of work to implement, try to do multiple smaller iterations and continue to add value to your end-users and customers.\nYou may find that you’ll get 80% of the scenarios done with 20% of the effort.\nIn other words, let your users show you their desire paths and implement the workflows your organization truly needs to solve business problems — not what you thought you needed.\nConclusion The Ohio State University campus story is a story I like to use to illustrate how it is better to design a simpler workflow and observe how people use your new system instead of over-complicating your process.\nI largely made up the details of the story. If anyone has a more accurate depiction of the story, please let me know.\nSources I inspired my definition from Jussia Hola’s great article on Desire Paths. I strongly recommend you read it. The Oval is a great article about the history behind the design of the campus. I largely inspired my narrative from that. Any inaccuracies are mine alone.

To top it off, I commute a total of 3 hours every day.\nWhen I get home from work, I’m usually exhausted.\nOne of my guilty pleasures is to play a video game with my kids. When they were younger, we’d play one of the many Lego games on Xbox. Now, we tend to play Halo or Call of Duty.\nRegardless of the age difference between my kids and me, the little buggers are worthy adversaries.\nThey might even be better than me– but don’t tell them I said that.\nI love that in the video game world, we’re able to play as equals. We’re sometimes teammates, partners, and sometimes enemies. We celebrate each other’s victories and tease each other’s failures.\nIn a household with three people diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, breaking barriers of communication and making emotional connections can sometimes be hard. Video games are one of the ways that we can connect.\nWhen I ponder about how lucky that we can share a moment like this over video games, it saddens me to think that there are people with physical disabilities who don’t have the opportunity to connect with their loved ones over a video game.\nBut things are changing, thanks to my friend Bryce Johnson and his team.\nWhat they did may seem very simple at first, and you may think that it only affects people with disabilities. Still, I believe that their achievements have much more significant ramifications.\nThe Xbox Adaptive Controller The Xbox Adaptive Controller is a funky-looking gaming input experience that allows people with limited mobility play video games by featuring large programmable buttons and providing the ability to add external devices such as switches, buttons, and joysticks.\nTo be clear, the Xbox Adaptive Controller (XAC) isn’t just for people with disabilities — Bryce is the Inclusive Lead for Microsoft Devices, and the last thing he and his team would want to do is design something that excludes other people from using it.\nThe XAC’s unique design, however, allows people with disabilities to play video games — just like everyone else.\nThere was a time where creating devices with accessibility in mind would be an after-thought for most companies because it would have such a \u0026ldquo;niche\u0026rdquo; market, or because it would increase the cost of production.\nBut with the XAC, Microsoft is sending a clear message: everyone matters. And everyone should be able to play equally.\nThe XAC isn’t just some rare device that only a few people can buy at an exorbitant price either; it is available in the Microsoft Store for a little more than a regular controller (and less than the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller.\nThe controller has gotten so much press coverage since its release (and won so many cool awards) that other large corporations are following suit.\nLogitech, for example, released its Adaptive Gaming Kit which gives users more options with customizable controls for the Xbox Adaptive Controller.\nYou read that right: instead of competing with Microsoft and releasing their own controller, they built controls that works with the XAC to add more capabilities! Something possible because the XAC is not only inclusive for people, but technologies; It works with standard connection types such as 3.5 mm jacks and USB 2.0 devices.\nAnd Logitech isn’t the only company doing this: PDP Gaming, QuadStick. AbleNet, and RAM Mounts are among the visionaries who work together to help empower XAC users.\nInclusivity is cool I have known Bryce Johnson for probably close to 20 years now (that’s right, I met him when I was eight!). He would come up with crazy user interface designs for SharePoint, and I would implement them.\nI would always love it when I would implement his designs, and people would say, \u0026ldquo;Wow, this looks good… there’s no way that’s SharePoint!\u0026rdquo;. It was especially rewarding to hear it from Microsoft employees!\nBack then, Bryce already had an eye for user experience design and inclusivity. Before it was ever cool to care about this stuff, Bryce designed everything with accessibility in mind.\nWe didn’t get to stay in touch when he went to Microsoft, but I was always delighted to read his updates on LinkedIn.\nIn May of 2018, when he started posting about the Xbox Adaptive Controller, I was really proud to be able to tell people that I knew him. I’m still proud!\nBryce will hate that I’m writing this article all about him, and I’m sure that he’ll remind me that he was only part of the team that made the XAC happen, but I know Bryce, and I know the kind of person he is. If the other members of his team are like him, they genuinely care about inclusive design and accessibility.\nI’m also thrilled to know that Microsoft is serious about inclusivity across their devices and that with Bryce as the Inclusive Lead of Microsoft Devices, the Xbox Adaptive Controller is probably the first of many cool products designed with heart and soul.\nI’m sure that the applications of the XAC will reach beyond gaming, and that we’ll see more devices change how people communicate and work together.\nConclusion You may not think that an Xbox controller would be such a big deal, but for someone with a disability who gets to play video games with their family and friends for the first time, I assure you that it can be life-changing.\nTo be able to play online and be treated as an equal by other players for the first time in someone’s life must be an amazing feeling.\nIf one of my children were disabled, I can’t imagine how it would be to be able to play video games with them for the first time thanks to the hard-work of the many team members at Microsoft who contributed to the XAC.\nDesigning with accessibility in mind makes a difference because it gives everyone the same opportunities.\nYou may not design hardware devices –like Bryce and the team– but if you maintain content in SharePoint, build applications in Power Apps, or create custom SPFx web parts, you can still make a positive impact with your users.\nIn my next posts for the SharePoint Framework Design Principles series, we’ll discuss accessibility design principles for SPFx solutions.\nIn the meantime, Bryce, I’m proud of the work you’re doing at Microsoft.

But you need to help your users transition to the new platform, and it should be as painless as possible for them.\nYou should spend some time preparing your users for the upcoming changes, educating them and answering their questions. Because, for most users, change is a scary thing.\nBut even if you spend countless hours educating your users and holding their hands through the migration process, they may still have bookmarks to content that you moved from your on-premises SharePoint server to SharePoint Online. They may have shortcuts and favorites?\nSome of the documents that you migrated may have links to your old on-premises SharePoint installation. Are you going to update every single document that contain hyperlinks to the old SharePoint site?\nAnd how can you whether your users are still trying to go to old on-prem SharePoint links that are no longer there?\nIn today’s post, we’ll bring an old feature back from the dead to help make your migration to SharePoint Online a lot easier for you and your users.\nIt only works in situations where you keep your old SharePoint on-premises (2013, 2016, and 2019) server up and running while you migrate the content from it to your SharePoint Online instance.\nBest of all, you won’t need to install any Dlls, Sandbox solutions, or Add-ons on your servers.\nThe original sharepointsmart404 Back in 2009 a brilliant person by the name of Josh Carlisle created a cool solution called sharepointsmart404. It enhanced the out-of-the-box SharePoint \u0026ldquo;Page Not Found\u0026rdquo; error (also known as a 404 error) to provide support for vanity URLs.\nA vanity URL, in case you’re wondering, is a unique URL branded for marketing purposes. Instead of using long and ugly URLs, you can use shorter, easier to remember URLs.\nWith smart 404, when people looked for a page or document that was no longer there, SharePoint would redirect them to the new location of that page/document as long as it found a matching vanity URL.\nNOTE: If you are the author of the original sharepointsmart404, or know the original author, I would like to link to their profile and give them credit. Please contact me, and I’ll make sure to update this post.\nHere is how the feature worked:\nWhen someone asks for a SharePoint URL which does not exist, SharePoint redirects to the 404 error page The feature intercepts the 404 error and looks for the requested URL against a list of vanity URLs. Each vanity URL entry consists of a requestURL (the URL that caused the page not found error), and a redirectURL (the URL where users should be redirected). If there is a matching vanity URL, redirect users to the redirectURL and don’t display the \u0026ldquo;Page Not Found\u0026rdquo; message If there isn’t a matching vanity URL, display the \u0026ldquo;Page Not Found\u0026rdquo; message This is the process there is a matching vanity URL:\nSyntax error in graphmermaid version 8.8.4\rThis is the process when there are no matching vanity URLs:\nSyntax error in graphmermaid version 8.8.4\rUnfortunately, the original smart 404 is no longer maintained and does not work on SharePoint 2013 or newer.\nBut the idea was brilliant. So much so that nearly 10 years later, I haven’t forgotten about it.\nBringing Smart 404 back from the dead I set out to re-create the smart 404 to help anyone who wants to migrate from SharePoint 2013, 2016, or 2019 to SharePoint Online.\nThe original version used an ASP.NET HttpModule to intercept the request and required deploying DLLs to the server; I wanted to re-create it without using any custom DLLs, Add-ins, or anything of the sort.\nTo make the solution easier to deploy on any version of SharePoint 2013 or later, I’ll provide the steps to create the required lists and deploy the feature using out-of-the-box features of SharePoint. The instructions should work for 2013, 2016, or 2019, but I was only able to test it in 2013 and 2019. Let me know if you find any issues.\nYou can also download the web part and list templates from my repo if you’d like.\nLeveraging PageNotFoundError.aspx Since SharePoint 2013, all 404 errors result in SharePoint displaying the PageNotFoundError.aspx, located in the Pages library of the root SharePoint site.\nWhen SharePoint redirects a request to the PageNotFoundError.aspx page, it adds a query string parameter called requestUrl, which contains the request URL (and caused a 404 error).\nSo if you requested a page called WheresMyStuff on your sharepoint.contoso.com server which resulted in a 404 error, SharePoint would redirect you to:\nhttps://sharepoint.consoso.com/Pages/PageNotFoundError.aspx?requestUrl=https://sharepoint.contoso.com/WheresMyStuff\rBut here is the secret: the PageNotFoundError.aspx is a standard SharePoint web part page!\nAnd our Smart 404 is just a regular good ol’ web part on that page!\nThe new Smart 404 solution There are three elements to the Smart 404 solution:\nThe VanityURLs list: A list which maps a redirectUrl for each requestUrl. The RedirectLog list: A list which records when the Smart 404 Web Part displays, the requested URL , who requested it, and what the outcome was. The Smart 404 Web Part: A Content Editor Web Part that points to an HTML page with Javascript, which redirects the user or displays a \u0026ldquo;Page Not Found\u0026rdquo; message. Let’s explore each component in details.\nThe Smart 404 Web Part The Smart 404 Web Part uses the Content Editor Web Part to embed some HTML in the PageNotFoundError.aspx page.\nThe HTML has some JavaScript which performs the following steps:\nWhen the page loads, it looks to see if there is a requestUrl parameter in the query string. If there is a requestUrl, it looks for a matching entry in the SmartRedirects list. If it finds a matching requestURL, it redirects the user to the matching redirectURL on SharePoint Online. It also creates an entry in the RedirectLogs list so that we can keep track of where we’re redirecting users. If it does not find a matching requestURL, it displays the \u0026ldquo;Page Not Found\u0026rdquo; error message (or, optionally, it redirects to the SharePoint Online search page). It also creates a record in the RedirectLogs list to record any potentially missing vanity URLs. The updated sequence diagram looks as follows:\nSyntax error in graphmermaid version 8.8.4\rWhen looking for a match, the Smart 404 uses the following logic:\nSyntax error in graphmermaid version 8.8.4\rThe VanityURLs List The VanityURLs list is a very simple list. It contains the following fields:\nTitle: A friendly title for your redirect. Not used by the web part, but helps make your list of Vanity URLs manageable. RequestURL: A text field containing the original URL of a resource. RedirectURL: The URL where you wish to redirect users when there is a matching RequestURL RedirectType: A choice field describing what type of redirect to use. The valid choices are either Exact Match, Begins With or Regular Expression RegExp: The regular expression to be used for Regular Expression matches Order: The priority for this vanity URL when more than one vanity URL matches the current URL The RedirectLog List The RedirectLog list contains the following fields:\nTitle: A simple text description of the outcome. RequestURL: The URL that was requested. Referrer: The HTTP Referrer (in case we were directed from somewhere else) RedirectedTo: The URL where we sent the user. Outcome:: Keeps track of whether users were redirected due to an exact match, a partial match, or if they were redirected to the search page because there weren’t any matching Vanity URLs. The list also contains the standard Created, CreatedBy, Modified, ModifiedBy fields, which are used to record who and when the redirection occurred.\nOnce you deploy the Smart 404 Web Part, you can monitor the logs and look for the following patterns:\nLarge numbers of No Match outcomes: Means that users are still trying to go to your old on-premises SharePoint server without a matching RedirectURL. You should consider finding where the content matching the RequestURL was relocated and create a new SmartRedirects item to redirect them to the right place. Many entries to the same RequestURL from multiple users: This means that somewhere out there, there is an old shortcut pointing to the on-premises SharePoint server that hasn’t been updated. It could be an existing system, a link in a document, etc. Look at the Referrer to see if they came from the same place. Many entries from the same user: This means that someone is being stubborn and has not updated their shortcuts to point to the new SharePoint Online tenant. They may simply need your help with updating their records. A decline in the frequency of records/no more records: This means that fewer people are trying to go to the old on-premises SharePoint server and that you should consider retiring your server without impacting your users. To deploy the Smart 404 solution As promised earlier, the Smart 404 solution does not require deploying any DLLs or add-ins to your servers. You simply need to create the required lists, add the Content Editor Web Part to your PageNotFoundError.aspx page, and start adding some entries in your SmartRedirects list.\nThe detailed instructions, along with the code for the Smart 404 Web Part, can be found on my Smart 404 repository, but he’s the summary:\nMake changes to the Smart404.html page as necessary to meet your own needs. For example, you can change the look and feel of the \u0026ldquo;Page Not Found\u0026rdquo; content template, or the \u0026ldquo;Your File Has Moved\u0026rdquo; template. Upload the modified Smart404.html page to your root site’s Site Assets folder Create the VanityURLs and RedirectLog lists (manually or using the list templates from the repo) Add a content viewer web part that points to your /SiteAssets/Smart404.html page to your PageNotFoundError.aspx Conclusion The process of migrating your SharePoint content from on-premises to SharePoint Online can take a while. During that time, your users may have shortcuts that point them to the old SharePoint instance.\nThe Smart 404 is a simple solution you can deploy on your on-premises SharePoint server that will replace the standard \u0026ldquo;Page Not Found\u0026rdquo; behavior of your SharePoint on-premises server to redirect users to the SharePoint Online equivalent of the content they were looking for.\nThanks Thanks to Gary Rong for helping build the code, and Rodney Hayden for being a test subject volunteer participant, Credit goes to Josh Carlisle for the original sharepointsmart404. Updates December 16, 2019: Gary Rong added logic to handle Regular Expressions and helped identify issues with the code in Internet Explorer, because — apparently — people still use IE?!?!.

Select Sign in to sync data.\nLog-in using your first set of Office 365 credentials by selecting existing credentials or by selecting Work or school account.\nOnce logged in, if you get prompted to Use your account everywhere on your device, uncheck Allow my organization to manage my device and select This app only instead of the Yes button.\nOnce you complete the steps, the new profile will open as a whole different process.\nRepeat the steps above to create additional profiles.\nHow to customize your profile When you create a new profile, the profile usually gets a default name — something like Profile 2.\nIf you have a lot of profiles, it may be easier to rename them so that you can tell them apart.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\nFrom Edge Chromium, tap the profile icon in the upper-right corner then select Manage profile settings\nFrom the Your profile window, select the ellipsis then Edit\nIn the Edit profile dialog, change the name of the profile to whatever you’d like, then select Update Setting your new tab experience Did you know that, in Edge Chromium, you can show your latest Office 365 files when you open a new browser tab?\nIt’s easy!\nAll you have to do is follow these steps:\nFrom a new browser tab, select the settings icon in the upper-right corner\nSelect Office 365 You’ll probably get prompted to log-in. Once you do, the you’ll get your Office 365 start page. Conclusion The concept of user profiles in your browser isn’t new, but it is new to Edge Chromium. It allows you to work as multiple users across multiple browser windows without having to use the Private mode.\nIf you use Chrome, I encourage you to find instructions to create new profiles. If you use Edge Chromium, I hope you’ll find the above steps useful!\n","permalink":"https://tahoeninja.blog/posts/working-as-multiple-office-365-users-using-user-profiles-in-edge-chromium/","tags":null,"title":"Working as multiple Office 365 users using user profiles in Edge Chromium"},{"categories":["Community"],"contents":"Introduction Making your first contribution to the SharePoint PnP community can be scary!\nDavid Warner II felt the same way before his first contribution.\nThat’s why his new Sharing is Caring initiative is designed to help everyone with their first contribution, or anyone who has already contributed but want to do more in the PnP community.\nHis goal is to make it less scary for everyone.\nAnd it can be plenty scary!\nYou are not alone I remember my first contribution to the SharePoint PnP community.\nI was terrified!\nI’ve been working with SharePoint since before it was called SharePoint. Heck, I’ve known SharePoint longer than I’ve known my wife!\nBut still, the first time I contributed to an issue in GitHub, I was convinced that I would be discovered as a fraud.\nInevitably, someone was going to find out I had made a mistake and ridicule me.\nI wasn’t well versed in GitHub. I was concerned that my code would irrevokably destroy the SharePoint repository –including every backup — and ruin it for everyone.\nI’d have to legally change my name, move somewhere far away, and go back to cooking professionally.\nEvery time I found a code or documentation issue, I would assume that someone much smarter than I would see the same problem and that they would fix it.\n\u0026ldquo;It isn’t my place,\u0026rdquo; I would tell myself.\n\u0026ldquo;They probably already know about this…\u0026rdquo; was my mantra. It was the thing I repeated to myself every time I considered contributing to the community until the urge to fix an issue would go away.\nAnd I’m not a timid person! I’m very strong-willed, stubborn, and opinionated. I’m blunt and direct (hey, if you wanted someone who’ll tell you what you want to hear, you should have hired someone else!).\nBut the idea of contributing to the PnP community felt like what Superman must feel when he’s near Kryptonite.\nUntil one day –when I probably had a momentary lapse in judgment– I submitted my first contribution and waited for the world to explode.\nWhen I got my first email telling me that my pull request was merged, I realized that I had been worrying for absolutely no reason. In fact, the reviewer who had accepted my pull request was very kind and grateful!\nIt gave me the courage to contribute a little more often.\nWith every new contribution, I grew more and more comfortable with GitHub, repos, and discussions, but I still felt nervous every time.\nOne day, when I was preparing to speak at a SharePoint Saturday, I started chatting with other speakers and talking about how nervous I was when contributing to the PnP community.\nOne after the other, they all admitted that they all felt the same way their first time.\nI couldn’t believe it!\nThose were people whose blogs I read, podcasts I listened to, and videos that I watched! They were the people whose presentations I attended at every conference I went to!\nAnd they all said that they were scared at first!!!\nJust like me!\nAnd, if you’re reading this, probably just like you too!\nYou too can contribute It doesn’t matter whether you have found an error in documentation, have a code sample to share, or want to participate in an open-source initiative, you have a voice!\nAnd it deserves to be heard, no matter how scared you may be!\nThat’s why David Warner created the Sharing Is Caring initiative.\nSharing Is Caring Sharing Is Caring is an official PnP GitHub repository that is intended to be a safe \u0026ldquo;sandbox\u0026rdquo; for those who want to learn to contribute and/or become more familiar with the PnP GitHub repos.\nIt is something that David, with the help of Vesa Juvonen, put together to help grow the PnP community and encourage contributions from new (and experienced) contributors.\nEvery month, David hosts live hands-on workshops where he’ll walk you through step-by-step instructions to contribute to a PnP repository.\nThe workshops are conducted over Microsoft Teams, and you are encouraged to use your camera and microphone to create a fun and relaxed atmosphere.\nDuring the sessions –hosted at different times of the day to accommodate people from all around the globe– you’ll get to use your own space in a GitHub repository. You can follow along, as David demonstrates how to make a contribution.\nThe first workshop shows you how you can fix a simple spelling mistake in the documentation. Future sessions will include things like creating list formatting samples, contributing to a PnP open-source initiative or creating your own SPFx web part or list extension code sample.\nBy the end of the session, you’ve made an official contribution (you’ll even get recognized on the monthly PnP calls!). More importantly, you realize that contributing isn’t as scary as it sounds and that it is very difficult to mess up. Github isn’t going to blow up after all!\nI had the privilege to help David host the very first Sharing Is Caring sessions last week. I watched as he patiently explained to 15 new PnP contributors on how to create their first pull requests.\nIt was great to meet people whose names I had seen countless times on the PnP calls and to interact with them. Because the sessions had few attendees, we got to chat (and we didn’t have to ask people to \u0026ldquo;Please please please mute yourself\u0026rdquo;) and joke a little.\nAs I was watched on the call, I remembered how nerve-wrecking my first contribution was, and how relieved I was when I realized that many others experienced that same thing. I didn’t do much, but I took a moment to tell the attendees that I had been where they were, and that contributing to the community can be very rewarding.\nI couldn’t help but feel that I was witnessing something important, because the Pnp community became 15-people stronger.\nThat’s 15 new people who are also passionate about SharePoint and Office 365 and who want to help others by sharing their knowledge.\nIf you’d like to contribute to the PnP community, but need a little help getting through your first contribution, fill the attendee registration form, and David will send you an invitation to his upcoming sessions.\nAnd I’ll be there to help!\nConclusion I’m constantly amazed at how generous people in the PnP community are. David will hate my saying this, but it is pretty amazing that he’s willing to spend his time to help other people learn to contribute.\nThe attendees are incredibly generous, because they spend the time out of their day to learn a skill that will help them donate more of their time to help others!.\nFinally, it also says a lot that both Microsoft and Vesa understand the importance of growing a strong community and that they are willing to let people like David (and I) host such sessions and officially recognize the attendees’ contributions.\nI hope to see many of you on upcoming calls, and I can’t wait to meet you all!\nPhoto Credits Image by Wokandapix from Pixabay\n","permalink":"https://tahoeninja.blog/posts/sharing-is-scaring/","tags":null,"title":"The Sharing is Caring Initiative"},{"categories":["SPFx"],"contents":"Introduction Scott Hanselman is someone that I admire, both as a Developer and as a Human Being. I never miss a chance to attend his presentations. I’m not smart enough to understand everything he talks about all the time, but he’s always entertaining to watch.\nEveryone once in a while, he creates an ultimate list of developer and power tools which always has one or two new tools I didn’t know about. Any serious developer should look at his list as a great starting point to configure their workstation.\nWhen SPFx first came out, I had never touched Node.js, React, or TypeScript. Visual Studio Code was (in my mind) just a free/lightweight version of Visual Studio — why would anyone use VS Code over the full-on Visual Studio?!\nAnd don’t get me started about GitHub!\nI had a steep learning curve ahead of me. And I had a whole new set of development tools to install on my workstation. It took me a while to figure out what I needed to install to be efficient at creating SPFx solution.\nI’m in the process of updating my Windows 10 workstation and, as I was writing down the list of things to re-install, I thought I’d share my list. This list is specifically for people who want to write SPFx solutions on Windows. It isn’t as comprehensive as Scott’s list, but I hope that it will help anyone getting started with SPFx development.\nI also work with .NET, Azure, VR and AR, and Dynamics 365, so I have other tools on my workstation, but I wanted to focus on SPFx development.\nIf you develop SPFx solutions and see that I forgot anything here, I would love to hear from you!\nNOTE: I’m a bit of a minimalist when it comes to installing stuff on my workstation. I hate installing things that will automatically start when I launch windows (that’s why I never install anything from Adobe anymore). You’ll rarely find anything in this article that will completely change how your operating system works or takes over your machine… and if you do, it is because I feel that the trade-off is worth it.\nMandatory Node.JS Find the .MSI file in the list that suits your workstation (x86 or x64). As tempting as it may be to download the latest version, don’t. The only version that is officially supported for SPFx development is 10.x.\nGulp Gulp is a tool that helps automate building your solutions. Once NodeJS is installed, install Gulp by launching the Node.js command prompt and type the following:\nnpm install -g gulp\rYeoman Yeoman is a tool that scaffolds solutions. Think of it as the Visual Studio new project wizard, if the new project wizard was command-line driven, open-sourced, and contained a bazillion project types. To install it, use your Node.js command prompt and type:\nnpm install -g yo\rSharePoint Framework Yeoman Generator Now that Yeoman is installed, you need to add what is essentially your \u0026ldquo;SPFx Project Wizard\u0026rdquo;. To do so, use your Node.js command prompt and type:\nnpm install -g @microsoft/generator-sharepoint\rRecommended Visual Studio Code When I first started writing SPFx solutions, I refused to use Visual Studio Code (real developers use Visual Studio, right?). Unfortunately, Visual Studio messed up my SPFx solutions more than once and I quickly learned to appreciate Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio no longer messes with your SPFx solutions, but I still use VS Code for all-things-SharePoint.\nGit for Windows Even if your company uses Azure DevOps or TFS for source control, you should install Git to make your life easier when downloading SPFx code samples.\nCmder for Windows If you’ve ever wondered what that cool command-line they use on the SharePoint Development Community calls, you have found it! Follow my instructions if you need help installing it. Fira Code Font This font will add the cool visualization to the Cmder command prompt. You should also configure it as your default Visual Studio Code font Cmder Powerline When paired with the Fira Code font (above), it will add that cool command-prompt to Cmder.\nPostman Test your APIs using this awesome tool. It can even intercept calls and replay them. I use this tool all the time when I’m trying to understand how SharePoint does something.\nFiddler Use Fiddler to capture your workstation’s network traffic and diagnose issues. For example, if you want to know how the Microsoft Teams app retrieves your list of groups, use Fiddler to capture what calls it makes.\nCLI for Microsoft 365 CLI A command-line interface that lets you do tons of stuff in Microsoft 365 and SPFx solutions. To install, use your Node.js command prompt and type the following:\nnpm i -g @pnp/cli-microsoft365\rPnP PowerShell An awesome library of PowerShell commands that allows you to perform complex provisioning and artifact management actions towards SharePoint. Uses a combination of CSOM and REST behind the scenes, and works against both SharePoint Online as SharePoint On-Premises.\nSharePoint Online Management Shell Use it to create SharePoint Online sites and add users, you can quickly and repeatedly perform tasks much faster than you can in the Office 356 admin center. You can also perform tasks that are not possible to perform in the Office 356 admin center.\nPnP Yeoman Generator If you find yourself always adding the PnP developer controls, PnP Property Controls, PnPJs, unit testing, etc. to your SPFx solutions, you should probably try the PnP Yeoman Generator. It is built on top of the SPFx Yeoman generator, so you’re not missing out on anything the SPFx generator will give you, but it automatically adds many other useful features — like unit testing, code linting, bundle optimization. To install it, use your Node.js command prompt and type:\nnpm install -g @pnp/generator-spfx\rVisual Studio Code Extensions GitHub Pull Requests Allows you to review and manage GitHub pull requests in Visual Studio Code. Paste JSON as Code Convert JSON object to typescript interfaces as you paste into Visual Studio Code. What, you thought I typed all those classes? Rencore Deploy SPFx Package Easily deploy a SharePoint Framework solution package to SharePoint Online directly from Visual Studio Code.\nRencore SPFx Script Check Using the Rencore Script Check Visual Studio Code extension you can easily reference external libraries in SharePoint Framework projects the right way. Additionally, you can ensure, that the CDN they are using is well performing.\nRencore Tenant-Wide SPFx Extension Deployment Easily add tenant-wide deployment information for your SPFx extension directly from Visual Studio Code.\nSPFx Debug Configuration This Visual Studio Code extension can be used to add the required configuration for debugging your SharePoint Framework.\nSPFx Essentials This is an extension pack that contains useful extension for SharePoint Framework projects. Most of the extensions I listed here are already included in Elio’s awesome list.\nSPFx Localization This extension for Visual Studio Code makes it easier to work with locale resource files in SharePoint Framework projects. The extension has the ability to export all locale labels to a CSV file to make translations easier to process. With this extension, you have absolutely no excuse to hard-code your text in English within your solutions. SPFx Snippet I never realized how much I use this extension until I tried to write spfx-rcc for a web part on a machine that didn’t have the extension installed. Take it from the World’s Laziest Developer, you need this extension. SPFx Task Runner This extension allows you to easily run SharePoint Framework tasks with a couple of mouse clicks. At the moment you can for example list all the available gulp tasks in your project, start the local development server and create debug or release solution packages or pick a task to run from the list of available tasks. SP Formatter Sergei strikes again with a great extension that works with the SP Formatter browser extension to make it easy to use syntax highlighting on list formatting.\nSharePoint Typed Item Sergei’s awesome extension generates interfaces based on list and content type fields. Also check out Sergei’s SPFx Rest Client Prettier — Code Formatter This extension format your JavaScript / TypeScript / CSS using Prettier.\nSPGo for Visual Studio Code SPGo allows you to develop SharePoint web solutions from your local PC using Visual Studio Code. It pulls down remote folders from SharePoint to your local workspace and automatically publishes files when you save. It is one of those \u0026ldquo;where has this been all my (SharePoint) life?!\u0026rdquo; extensions.\nDocs Authoring Pack If you maintain any kind of Markdown documentation, or if you contribute to Microsoft Docs (you should!), you should install this extension pack that will make your life much easier. Thanks to Paul Bullock for pointing this one out.\nCodeTour CodeTour is an awesome Visual Studio Code extension, which allows you to record and playback guided code walkthroughs. I’ve been using it to add tours to all my new web part projects and adding new tours to my old SPFx samples in the Samples repo. Nice to have Zoomit Be a considerate presenter! If you do presentations and show your code, you should consider installing this tool. Those people in the back of the room (who sat in the back so that they can exit quickly if they find you boring) may not exit so fast if they can actually see what you’re doing.\nPaint.NET A great image editing tool that’s fully featured and free. I use it to edit icons and other assets.\nInkscape A powerful SVG editing tool. I use it to create SVG icons. If only I could get SVG icons to work consistently in SPFx, it’d be great.\nSnagIt Probably the golden standard for screen capture tools. I stubbornly used the Windows Snipping Tool for the longest time until I reluctantly installed SnagIt and I don’t think I’ll use anything but SnagIt from now on. If you write any kind of documentation, help guides, or blogs, this is a must.\nCamtasia Like SnagIt, I used to avoid it because I was too cheap to pay for the license… but if you do any kind of video editing, give this one a try. It is fantastic. (Why do I have to be so stubborn?!)\nScreenToGif Do everyone a favor and show an animated GIF of what your SPFx solutions can do in the README.MD file. It saves them having to install your solution to see what it does. This tool is a screen, webcam and sketchboard recorder with an integrated editor that makes it super-easy to create animated GIFs. Available as a Microsoft Store App or a WPF install. Browser Extensions Note that these extensions can be used in Chrome or in Edge Chromium. (I use Edge Chromium, personally).\nSP Editor A Google Chrome Extension for creating and updating files (js, css), injecting files to sites, modifying web/list property bag values (add, edit, remove, index) and creating webhook subscriptions, edit/add/remove web parts from publishing pages and run sp-pnp-js typescript snippets in SP2013, SP2016 and SharePoint Online from Chrome Developer Tools. This tool will help you create amazing SharePoint applications fast from your browser from any computer which runs Chrome!\nReact Developer Tools Allows you to inspect the React component hierarchies in the Chrome Developer Tools. You get a new tab called React in your Chrome DevTools which shows you the root React components that were rendered on the page, as well as the subcomponents that they ended up rendering. It is great when trying to understand how the SharePoint team built a component.\nScreen Reader for Google Chrome Test your web parts for accessibility by giving you the same experience your users will get when they use a screen reader.\nAXE No, not the body spray. Use this tool to check for accessibility for WCAG 2.0 and Section 508 accessibility. If you aren’t testing for accessibility, you’re possibly making it difficult for 10 to 20% of your users.\nRefined GitHub If you use GitHub regularly, but get a little annoyed with some missing features, this extension is for you. It adds tons of cool features including my favorites: remove changes to individual files in a commit/pull request and download a folder. SP Formatter Not so much a developer-focused extension, but a very useful one nevertheless. SP Formatter adds JSON syntax highlighting, live preview, and autocompletion to SharePoint list formatting. Websites PnP Home Can’t keep up with all the new things that the Microsoft 365 PnP community members are doing? You can find everything in one convenient place. SharePoint Look Book Get inspired with cool looking SharePoint sites. SharePoint Design Guidance Learn how to create great looking SharePoint solutions. Fluent UI See what components are at your disposal when building awesome Microsoft 365 solutions.\nPnP/PnPJS PnPjs is a collection of fluent libraries for consuming SharePoint, Graph, and Microsoft 365 REST APIs in a type-safe way. You can use it within SharePoint Framework, Nodejs, or any JavaScript project. This an open source initiative and we encourage contributions and constructive feedback from the community.\nReusable property pane controls for the SharePoint Framework solutions This repository provides developers with a set of reusable property pane controls that can be used in their SharePoint Framework (SPFx) solutions. Reusable React controls for your SharePoint Framework solutions Provides developers with a set of reusable React controls that can be used in SharePoint Framework (SPFx) solutions. The project provides controls for building web parts and extensions. You should really try the ChartControl 🙂 Microsoft 365 \u0026amp; SharePoint Community – PnP (YouTube) YouTube channel with SharePoint Dev Weekly videos, SharePoint Framework Tutorials and Training videos, SharePoint Framework and Extensions Tutorials, Getting Started videos, PnP Webcasts, etc. If you no like read, you watch these good.\nBase64 Image Encoder Use this site to encode your web part icons to base 64. You can also use my interactive post to do all the work for you. EzGif.com If you don’t want to install ScreenToGif but want to create animated GIFs to help people see what your web part will look like without having to install it, I recommend using this web site. Create a video of your web part in action, then use EZ GIF’s Video to animated GIF converter to create your GIF. Add the GIF to your README.MD file and people will see how cool your web part really is! GitHub Repos Microsoft Fluent UI When I want to learn how to create awesome React components, I take my inspiration from Microsoft Fluent UI.\nSP Dev FX WebParts Almost every SPFx project I create starts from one of the many samples available on this awesome repo.\nPnP Property Controls Back when most of us were still learning React and SPFx, they were already creating re-usable controls for SPFx. Take some time to read their code for inspiration.\nPnP Developer Controls From the brilliant minds that brought you the PnP Property Controls. Read the code to learn tons!\nSharePoint Starter Kit Look at some of the best solutions used to build the perfect demo environments.\nConclusion This article listed the various tools I use when building SPFx solutions on a Windows 10 workstation. As I stated previously, I’m kind of a minimalist when it comes to installing stuff on my machine. I’m sure that there are many other tools that I should install, but I haven’t found a need for it yet. What other tools do you install on your workstation? Let me know in the comments.\nUpdate Feb 4, 2021: Added SP Formatter VS Code Extension. Mind.blown. September 7, 2020: Added Enhanced GitHub.

However, base64-encoded SVG images — as is shown in the documentation — don’t work as expected. And by the looks of it, this hasn’t worked for a while.\nSince the SPFx team has been working tirelessly to deliver more than 15 releases of SPFx since its general availability, I’m sure we can forgive them for letting something so minor fall through the cracks.\nHowever, I really don’t like how icons that were converted from PNG look slightly blurry. (I tend to obsess about little things like that sometimes).\nAs I was writing another post for my SharePoint Framework Design series, I decided to get to the bottom of the issue.\nAs it turns out, it was pretty easy to solve.\nTL;DR This is an interactive post: we’ll convert your SVG so that you can use it as an SPFx web part icon.\nIf you don’t care about the explanation, you can go straight to the solution\nThe Challenge My challenge was that I wanted to use SVG images in my web part’s manifest, but I didn’t want to have a separate SVG asset. I wanted to define a base64-encoded SVG file, as is demonstrated in the SharePoint documentation.\nI knew it didn’t work (believe me, I’ve tried), so I wanted a solution that would not rely on any unsupported hacks.\nSince I don’t have access to change the SharePoint code, I needed a solution that would work without requiring any changes from SharePoint.\nHow SPFx web part icons work According to the Microsoft documentation, for your SPFx web part icon you can use either an Office UI Fabric icon, an external icon image, or a base64-encoded image.\nTo change your icon to an Office UI Fabric icon, you simply open your web part’s [YourWebPartName].manifest.json and change the \u0026quot;officeFabricIconFontName\u0026quot; node to the name of the icon you want from the UI Fabric site.\nThe default icon is Page. If you wanted to change your icon to the Sunny icon, you would simply change the following line:\n\u0026#34;officeFabricIconFontName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Page\u0026#34;, To this:\n\u0026#34;officeFabricIconFontName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Sunny\u0026#34;, Note that you have to re-build the web part (run gulp build) and reload your workbench (press [F5] on your keyboard) before you’ll see the new icon. Trust me, I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out why my new icons weren’t showing up.\nIf you want to set the icon to an external image, you’ll want to find the URL of a publicly-accessible image and change your web part’s manifest \u0026quot;officeFabricIconFontName\u0026quot; attribute from the following:\n\u0026#34;officeFabricIconFontName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Page\u0026#34;, For a \u0026quot;iconImageUrl\u0026quot; image URL, as follows:\n\u0026#34;iconImageUrl\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://assets.contoso.com/weather.png\u0026#34;, You can also use a CDN, or use your SharePoint CDN to store your images.\nIf you don’t want to use an external image, you’ll want to use a base64-encoded image.\nTo do so, you’ll have to first convert your image using a tool like this web site. Once you have your base64-encoded image, you’ll change your web part’s manifest from this:\n\u0026#34;officeFabricIconFontName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Page\u0026#34;, To this:\n\u0026#34;iconImageUrl\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;data:...\u0026#34;, And you would put the entire base64-encoded string as the web part’s URL. Because you see, the base64-encoded string is actually a valid URL.\nIt is just a special kind of URL, called a data URI.\nAbout data URI Base64-encoded images, whether they are SVG or PNG, JPG, or GIF, rely on data URI. Data URI allow you to embed a resource in a URI which would normally result in a separate HTTP request.\nMost data URI consists of the data type of the item (e.g.: image/png), followed by a semicolon, and the data of that file.\nThe cool thing about data URI is that — on most modern browsers — you can pretty much use them anywhere you would normally use a link to a resource.\nFor example, to show the above image of Parker in HTML, you would embed an img element and point the src attribute to the URL of the image, as follows:\n\u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/31443929?s=200\u0026amp;v=4\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; Using a data URI, you could also do this:\n\u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAMgAAADICAYAAACtWK6eAABpUUlEQVR4nOxdBVgU2xc/S3d3d0iDtKgI2N3d+tBnd+uzu7D924mJGIgoIAooKiGIIp1KLsvS+f/mbrAxu+xiofL75JvZmTt3Ztd75vQ5Qi0tLdCJTnQCHwK/+gE60YmOjE4C6... Which produces this image:\nThe first version of this image had a URL pointing to the original source of the image, while the second one contained the actual image!\nTo generate the super-long gibberish, I used this online base64-encoder and uploaded a copy of Parker’s avatar, then copied that super-long string it generated into the src attribute of my img tag.\nYou have to base64-encode the image because you’re trying to embed a binary file inside of HTML.\nExcept that SVG files are not binaries…\nUsing data URI without base64-encoding SVG files are simply text markup files, like HTML.\nDuring my research, I found an article entitled Probably don’t base64 SVG which explains that when you base64-encode an image…\n\u0026ldquo;It takes 4 characters per 3 bytes of data, plus potentially a bit of padding at the end.\u0026rdquo;\nEssentially, base64-encoding SVG takes more room than the original file! Files are essentially 133% bigger!\nFortunately, you can actually use your UTF-8 encoded SVG file inside a data URI as follows:\n\u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;data:image/svg+xml; ... \u0026#34;\u0026gt; Now, you need to make sure that you don’t embed unsupported characters inside your src attribute. For example, if your SVG has a single quote (') and your src attribute uses single-quotes to define it, you’ll want to escape the '.\nFortunately, Taylor Hunt wrote a great article explaining how to encode SVGs in data URI while optimizing them to help you with that.\nTaylor’s awesome article inspired someone to write a codepen to encode SVGs.\nI forked Jakob-e’s codepen to make my own which makes it easy to encode SVGs to work as a data URI icon for a web part’s manifest.\nUsing a data URI SVG as your icon To use your custom SVG as an icon, take the following steps:\nDesign an icon so that it fits within a square, ideally 64×64, or at least 32×32.\nMake sure that your icon \u0026lt;svg\u0026gt; element sets the width and height attributes — otherwise, your icon will be cropped and/or will not appear centered. To do so, simply change your SVG opening tag from:\n\u0026lt;svg\u0026gt; To this:\n\u0026lt;svg height=\u0026#34;64\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;64\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Consider optimizing your SVG by using SVGOMG or a similar tool.\nPaste your SVG in the box below to encode your SVG\nCustomize this article Variable Value Original SVG In your web part’s [YourWebPartName].manifest.json, change the following line:\n\u0026#34;officeFabricIconFontName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Page\u0026#34;, To this:\nPaste your SVG above to generate this code\rCopy to clipboard\nPaste your SVG above to generate this code\nCopy to clipboard\nDon’t forget the extra , at the end of the line.\nRebuild your web part by running gulp build\nRefresh your workbench\nYour new SVG icon should appear!\nConclusion You still can’t use base64-encoded icons as your web part icon — at that’s probably a good thing, because base64-encoded SVG files are bigger! — but you can use a data URI image instead.\nThis article shows you how to convert your SVG so that it will produce beautiful web part icons.\nRegardless of whether Microsoft ever fixes the issue with SVG icons for web parts, you should still consider optimizing your SVG before using it in your solutions.\nI hope this helps?\nUpdates September 1, 2019: This approach will also work for application extension.

It provides design guidance on beautiful and fast sites, pages, and web parts with SharePoint in Office 365.\nHowever, it does not tell you how to create those beautiful web parts.\nThis blog series is intended as a companion to the SharePoint Design site. It provides code samples and detailed how-to information for every design topic.\nIt should help you create web parts that look exactly like the ones on the SharePoint Design site.\nSo far, we have discussed the following topics:\nWeb Part Titles and Descriptions Property Panes, Part I Property Panes, Part II Property Panes, Part III Layout Patterns, Part I: The Grid layout Layout Patterns, Part II: The Filmstrip layout Layout Patterns, Part III: The Carousel layout In today’s post, we’ll continue our discussion about the web part layout patterns and discuss the compact layout.\nWhat is the Compact layout? According to the SharePoint Design site:\nThe compact layout is designed to show content in a smaller format and works the best in a one-third column. This layout can support a small image or icon and a few rows of text for a title, description, and/or metadata.\nHowever, it seems that the compact layout is not only used in 1/3 columns. The SharePoint look book and the SharePoint Online Provisioning Service both make use of the compact layout with the Quick Links web part.\nWhen to use the compact layout Use the compact layout when the items in your web part have very little information. A title and an icon or a small thumbnail is pretty much all you’ll be able to fit it.\nHow is it made? The compact layout is simply a Grid layout, but where the individual items use a compact document card layout instead of the full document card.\nTo create your own, you would use an Office UI Fabric List control and render each item inside the list with a DocumentCard control where the type of the DocumentCard control would be set to DocumentCardType.compact.\nOr, you can simply use the component I built to make my life easier.\nHow to create a web part with the compact layout Note: The source code for this sample can be found in the WebPartLayouts sample on my repo.\nCreate your own web part solution. For this sample, we’ll assume that your web part is called CompactWebPart and that the component which renders the content of the web part is called Compact.\nCopy the content of the src\\components\\compactLayout from my sample code to your own solution. You may need to create a components and compactLayout folder under src to do so.\nIn your web part, load the items you wish to display. For this example, we’ll set them in your web part’s state and hard-code them in your web part’s constructor, but feel free to load any data you want to use. We’ll want to have at least a title attribute and a thumbnail attribute, but — as you’ll see later — you can really display any information you want when you render each item.\nconstructor(props: ICompactProps) { super(props); // Sample data generated at https://mockaroo.com/ this.state = { items: [{ thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/nostrumquiiure.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Aerified\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/minimafugitenim.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Viva\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/nihilbeataeculpa.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Overhold\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/essequiquo.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Latlux\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/inipsumtotam.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Biodex\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/utmodiet.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Bitchip\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/undeenimvel.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Rank\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/pariaturoditdolore.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Opela\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/nullaullamincidunt.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Rank\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/accusantiumnonvoluptatibus.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Bitchip\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/culpaeossapiente.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Sonsing\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/harumnihilvelit.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Duobam\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/quianesciuntet.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Prodder\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/aliquidipsamrem.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Keylex\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/dignissimoseosaccusamus.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Span\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/exomnisexcepturi.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Stringtough\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/occaecatimolestiaererum.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Prodder\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/consequaturinquis.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Alpha\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/sapienteofficiisest.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Job\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/similiquesuntiusto.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Cookley\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/sitnequequi.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Stronghold\u0026#34; }] }; } In your web part’s component, add an import for the compactLayout. You’ll also need an import for the UI Fabric DocumentCard component:\n// Used to render document cards import { DocumentCard, DocumentCardPreview, DocumentCardDetails, DocumentCardTitle, IDocumentCardPreviewProps, DocumentCardType } from \u0026#39;office-ui-fabric-react/lib/DocumentCard\u0026#39;; import { ImageFit } from \u0026#39;office-ui-fabric-react/lib/Image\u0026#39;; import CompactLayout from \u0026#39;../../../components/compactLayout/CompactLayout\u0026#39;; Add a _onRenderGridItem method:\nprivate _onRenderGridItem = (item: any, _index: number): JSX.Element =\u0026gt; { const previewProps: IDocumentCardPreviewProps = { previewImages: [ { previewImageSrc: item.thumbnail, imageFit: ImageFit.centerCover, height: 48, width: 48 } ] }; return \u0026lt;div data-is-focusable={true} data-is-focus-item={true} role=\u0026#34;listitem\u0026#34; aria-label={item.title} \u0026gt; \u0026lt;DocumentCard type={DocumentCardType.compact} onClick={(ev: React.SyntheticEvent\u0026lt;HTMLElement\u0026gt;) =\u0026gt; alert(ev)} \u0026gt; \u0026lt;DocumentCardPreview {...previewProps} /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;DocumentCardDetails\u0026gt; \u0026lt;DocumentCardTitle title={item.title} shouldTruncate={true} /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/DocumentCardDetails\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/DocumentCard\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;; } } Update your component’s render method to render the compact layout as follows:\npublic render(): React.ReactElement\u0026lt;ICompactProps\u0026gt; { return ( \u0026lt;div className={styles.compact}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;CompactLayout items={this.state.items} onRenderGridItem={(item: any, index: number) =\u0026gt; this._onRenderGridItem(item, index)} /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } That’s really all there is to it! You web part will render something like this:\nThe great thing is that it is entirely up to you how you want to render each item. I chose to use the DocumentCard control, but you can replace any part of your _onRenderGridItem method to suit your needs.\nFor example, if you wanted to render a date instead of an thumbnail, you could use something like the DateBox component that I wrote for the React Calendar Feed sample.\nAdding pagination When I first built the React Calendar Feed sample, the Events web part showed little Previous and Next buttons at the bottom of the web part when displaying in the compact mode.\nIt seems that the pagination has since been removed from the standard web part design. Nevertheless, I have included a sample control to show how you can add pagination to your compact web part.\nUse it at your discretion.\nTo add pagination to your web part, follow these steps:\nCopy the content of the src\\components\\paging from my sample code to your own solution. You may need to create a paging folder under src\\components to do so.\nAdd a variable to store the current page number in your component’s state, as follows:\nexport interface ICompactState { items: any[]; currentPage: number; } In your component’s constructor, set the current page to 1, as follows:\nconstructor(props: ICompactProps) { super(props); // Sample data generated at https://mockaroo.com/ this.state = { currentPage: 1, items: [{ thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/nostrumquiiure.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Aerified\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/minimafugitenim.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Viva\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/nihilbeataeculpa.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Overhold\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/essequiquo.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Latlux\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/inipsumtotam.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Biodex\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/utmodiet.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Bitchip\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/undeenimvel.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Rank\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/pariaturoditdolore.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Opela\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/nullaullamincidunt.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Rank\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/accusantiumnonvoluptatibus.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Bitchip\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/culpaeossapiente.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Sonsing\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/harumnihilvelit.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Duobam\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/quianesciuntet.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Prodder\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/aliquidipsamrem.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Keylex\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/dignissimoseosaccusamus.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Span\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/exomnisexcepturi.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Stringtough\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/occaecatimolestiaererum.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Prodder\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/consequaturinquis.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Alpha\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/sapienteofficiisest.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Job\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/similiquesuntiusto.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Cookley\u0026#34; }, { thumbnail: \u0026#34;https://robohash.org/sitnequequi.png?size=48x48\u0026amp;set=set1\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Stronghold\u0026#34; }] }; } Add an import for the paging component at the top of your file:\nimport { Paging } from \u0026#39;../../../components/paging\u0026#39;; Change your render method to get a subset of items to show, as follows:\npublic render(): React.ReactElement\u0026lt;ICompactProps\u0026gt; { let pagedItems: any[] = this.state.items; const totalItems: number = pagedItems.length; let showPages: boolean = false; const maxEvents: number = 5; // Use any page size you want const { currentPage } = this.state; if (true \u0026amp;\u0026amp; totalItems \u0026gt; 0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; totalItems \u0026gt; maxEvents) { // calculate the page size const pageStartAt: number = maxEvents * (currentPage - 1); const pageEndAt: number = (maxEvents * currentPage); pagedItems = pagedItems.slice(pageStartAt, pageEndAt); showPages = true; } return ( \u0026lt;div className={styles.compact}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;CompactLayout items={pagedItems} onRenderGridItem={(item: any, index: number) =\u0026gt; this._onRenderGridItem(item, index)} /\u0026gt; {showPages \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \u0026lt;Paging showPageNumber={true} currentPage={currentPage} itemsCountPerPage={maxEvents} totalItems={totalItems} onPageUpdate={this._onPageUpdate} nextButtonLabel={strings.NextLabel} previousButtonLabel={strings.PreviousLabel} /\u0026gt; } \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } Finally, add a method to store the current page number in your state every time the page changes, as follows:\nprivate _onPageUpdate = (pageNumber: number): void =\u0026gt; { this.setState({ currentPage: pageNumber }); } Test your web part. You should now get a next and previous buttons at bottom of your web part.\nConclusion The compact layout is simply a grid control which renders compact document cards.\nIn our next post, we’ll discuss the list layout!\n","permalink":"https://tahoeninja.blog/posts/sharepoint-framework-design-series-layout-patterns-part-iv/","tags":null,"title":"SharePoint Framework Design Series: Layout Patterns — Part IV"},{"categories":["GitHub"],"contents":"Introduction In August of 2019, I wrote a post called My GitHub cheat sheet for PnP contributions — an interactive cheat sheet which explains the GitHub commands that I use when I start a contribution. The post is interactive: you just tell it your GitHub username and what repository you want to contribute to, and it customizes the instructions for you.\nNOTE: I have since updated the interactive cheat sheet to a Summary Cheat Sheet with all the same interactive steps, but without all the lengthy explanation.\nI also wrote another post talking about how impressed I am with David Warner II’s offer to help anyone with their first contribution. I have since joined the Sharing is Caring initiative and proudly co-host all the session with David Warner\nAfter briefly chatting with David I realized that the biggest hurdle for people is that they just don’t know where to get started. In my post, I recommend that you read the contribution guidelines for every repo, but I found that they are often hard to find in each repository.\nI also say that most repositories want you to start from the dev branch, but as the Chris Kent pointed out in the August 22nd PnP community call, some repositories prefer you use the master (or, more and more commonly, the main) branch.\nSo, with David’s help, we compiled a list of the most common PnP repositories to help you get started. We only show the repositories that provide contribution guidelines.\nThe list contains the following:\nRepo: Name of the repository What is it?: Description of the repository Getting started: Links to the most likely resource if you want to get started contributing to that repository Branch: The branch you should target when submitting your pull requests NOTE: The information in each of the repositories can change and that you should always refer to the repository for the latest information.\nPopular repositories Repo What is it?

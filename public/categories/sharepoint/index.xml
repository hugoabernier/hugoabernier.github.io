      <description>Sometimes, you need to create a view in a SharePoint list where the items are sorted using a custom sort order. For example, if you had a list of items that needs to be sorted by Rating where the possible choices are High, Medium, and Low, your list items would appear in the following order: High, Low, and Medium because SharePoint will want to sort your Rating values alphabetically.</description>
